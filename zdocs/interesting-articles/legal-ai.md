## 1 Introduction

The legal profession is undergoing a significant transformation, driven in part by advances in AI \[1\]. As AI becomes increasingly adept at understanding and generating human language, its potential for streamlining complex legal processes is becoming evident. Tasks such as reviewing legal documents, conducting research, and drafting contracts can now be supported or automated with the help of AI tools \[2\]. However, the integration of AI into legal applications presents challenges, including the tendency of AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), to produce misleading or incorrect information—a phenomenon known as “hallucinations” \[3, 4\]. Ethical AI in legal applications ensures fairness, transparency, and accountability, aligning AI-driven decisions with established legal standards and human-centric values to enhance trust and reliability \[5\].

These errors arise because AI models generate responses based on patterns identified in their training data rather than on verified legal facts \[6\]. While this allows for the creation of fluent and coherent text, it also introduces the risk of inaccuracies that can have serious legal consequences. In an industry where precision and reliability are paramount, such mistakes can significantly undermine the effectiveness of AI solutions in legal contexts.

Simultaneously, there is a growing global demand for affordable legal services. Traditional legal support is often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming \[7\], leaving many individuals without adequate representation. AI holds the promise of making legal assistance more accessible and scalable, particularly for routine tasks like document analysis and preliminary consultations. This potential underscores the critical need for AI systems that are not only efficient but also highly accurate and reliable.

To address the issues of inaccuracy and enhance AI’s applicability in legal services, we propose a novel framework that incorporates a mixture of expert systems alongside a knowledge-based architecture. This framework strategically allocates legal tasks to specialized modules, or “experts,” each designed to handle specific areas of law. By utilizing focused, domain-specific knowledge, the system ensures that legal advice and analysis are more precise and contextually relevant compared to general-purpose AI models. Additionally, a knowledge integration system underpins the framework by providing access to reliable legal information, thereby reducing the likelihood of errors.

Beyond the architectural enhancements, our framework implements structured operational guidelines modeled on real-world legal practices. These guidelines emulate the methodologies employed by law firms, ensuring that the AI follows a systematic approach in tasks such as information gathering, analysis of legal precedents, and formulation of conclusions. This structured methodology helps prevent the compounding of errors, thereby improving the overall quality and reliability of the AI-generated legal outputs.

Our approach demonstrates significant improvements over existing models, particularly in handling the complexities of legal language and logical reasoning. Compared to other AI systems, our model achieves better results in legal benchmarking tests and real-world case studies, highlighting its ability to provide more dependable legal advice. By combining specialized expert knowledge with a structured operational framework, this solution paves the way for more accurate, efficient, and accessible legal services.

In the following sections, the **Literature Review (Section 2)** of this paper highlights the developments in LLMs like GPT-4 for legal tasks, addressing challenges such as domain specificity and hallucinations. **Section 3** details the **Methodology**, which integrates cutting-edge AI techniques like RAG, KGs, a MoE framework, and RLHF to deliver accurate and reliable legal analysis. This section also includes subsections for **Dataset Selection**, which outline the diverse datasets employed to evaluate the system. The **System Architecture** subsection provides a detailed description of the working of the system, which employs a multi-stage workflow enhanced by KGs.

The **RLHF Component (Section 8)** improves system alignment with user feedback. The **Results and Discussion (Section 9)** showcase significant performance gains in metrics like Rouge-L and BLEU, demonstrating the framework’s strengths. Finally, the **Conclusion (Section 10)** highlights the system’s effectiveness and potential future enhancements, including expert module expansion and real-time updates.

We will explore the design and development of this system in detail, outlining the key challenges it addresses and the potential it offers for the future integration of AI within the legal sector.

## 2 Literature Review

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 \[8\] and GPT-4 \[9\], have marked significant advancements in natural language processing (NLP) through their transformer-based architecture. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance across various text generation tasks, excelling in areas like text summarization and question answering (Q/A) \[10\]. However, the success of these LLMs largely hinges on training data from general-purpose domains. This becomes problematic when applying them to specialized fields like law, which is characterized by intricate language, domain-specific terminology, and nuanced logic.

To bridge this gap, researchers have turned to fine-tuning LLMs specifically for legal tasks. By adapting pre-trained models with legal data, LLMs can better capture the complexities of legal texts \[11\]. The process of fine-tuning allows these models to utilize their inherent strengths in language generation while integrating the specialized knowledge required for tasks such as contract analysis, statutory interpretation, and case law reasoning. This literature review critically examines the existing techniques employed for major NLP tasks in the legal domain, with a focus on text summarization and question-answering.

Key areas of exploration include:

- The potential benefits and limitations of fine-tuning LLMs for legal applications.  
- Promising and cost-effective methods for successfully adapting LLMs.
