Maybe in the evening we will go to flamenco, but I will most likely be able to pick up my things on Sunday. \nIf it is ok. \n\nI kinda miss you\n(üëç 1)\nRegina: Thank you\nRegina: Hey party animal and nerd.\n\n I want to talk to your clone but I only watched 3 minutes so I don't know how it works yet. \n\nI spend 100% of my time with my sister and we fight all the time lol. She's definitely teaching me patience üòÖ\nRegina: Hey,\n\nI want to take some stuff in the evening if it's okay üôÇ\n(üëç 1)\nRegina: You're in the office, right? I want to come if you have time to share updates, I am curious. \nStaying in the Phrom Phong area now\n\nBut if you're busy, it's okay\nSimon Jackson: Yes here but don‚Äôt want to talk\nRegina: Got it, enjoy your time üôèüèª\nSimon Jackson: Never\nRegina: Never what?\nSimon Jackson: Anything\nRegina: Never enjoying your time?\nSimon Jackson: Can‚Äôt respond\nRegina: You are doing great learning new things and following your own path. That's enough\nRegina: Wanted to share some info but sometimes I don't know how.. when you are busy\nSimon Jackson: what info\nSimon Jackson: I see everything\nRegina: 1. I am also dealing with AI. But it's Annoying Irritation üò• so I am taking antibiotics. And we should be more serious about having sex without a condom. \n\n2. The honey I brought is famous in Russia. If you don't eat it, you can share it with Kee. Also earrings, they are cheap, but they remind me of your shirt.\n\n3. I am not sure about the job, because they said I might be useful since January, not now. But thank you anyway.\n\n4. Your colleagues are concerned about your KPI, but they may not verbalize it, building up some discontent.\n\n5. I like to hangout but I guess you are not very very social. Maybe I also need to lock in.\nSimon Jackson: thanks for the info\nSimon Jackson: yeah - i think my time here in general is close to end. better for me to move on to what i‚Äôm actually interested in\n(üôè 1)\nSimon Jackson: lets see how everythig goes\nSimon Jackson: 1) did you get something ?\n2) ok\n3) ok\n4) ok\n5) yeah, mainly interested in making stuff. so if someone is making something themselves or is planning on it or is about relevant things, it could be interesting. otherswise, not so interested in smalltalk\nSimon Jackson: whats AI ?\nRegina: 1. The last time I got tested was October 8-9 (I sent you the results). \nI had some problems with my microflora, but almost no symptoms. This time, a few days after sex, I started feeling irritated, so I just bought the antibiotics they recommended for microflora and I started taking them today. \n\nI'm not sure, maybe I should get tested again. \n\nI only had sex with you. Maybe you also should check yourself to make sure everything is okay, because some things can exist without any symptoms. I want to make sure everything is okay for both of us. \n\nI also need to get a blood test, in October I was told to wait until the end of November\nRegina: Annoying Irritation lol. I am just trying to stay positive even when I am sick\nRegina: 5. I understand it. I like to discuss ideas, not sure if I am interested in participating, but I can understand what works and what doesn't\nRegina: 1. Let me know what you think. I think maybe I should take a test tomorrow and therefore not take another pill today. I don't think my condition changed from one pill, I only feel a little dizzy\nSimon Jackson: if you feel sick, you should see if there‚Äôs something wrong\nRegina: Yeah, you're right. Will do tomorrow\nRegina: Are you by chance in the office tonight? I just have no will to carry all my stuff and go back to the lab in the morning\nSimon Jackson: always\nRegina: Can I come later with my laptop? won't bother you with smalltalk\nSimon Jackson: if you want\n(üôè 1)\nRegina: 15 minutes\nRegina: Arrived\nSimon Jackson: you heer\nSimon Jackson: ok one sec\nRegina: Have already received the test results. \n\nOverall, it felt like vaginal thrush, which I have had twice in my life before, not even having sex with anyone. \nAlthough this time my symptoms include only annoying irritation. \nTaking one 150 mg dose of fluconazole helped me, so I am going to do the same.  \n\nNot sure if you should get any tests done if you are not experiencing any symptoms\nRegina: üìÑ [Ms. REGINA FILKO 2411270011817OR_Detected (1).pdf]\nSimon Jackson: Ok so all is good or\nRegina: üñº [Picture]\nSimon Jackson: I‚Äôm not reading\nSimon Jackson: good or no?\nRegina: It's gonna be fine for me soon. and it's not dangerous for you too\nSimon Jackson: cool\nSimon Jackson: good day\nRegina: I need to protect sensitive pussy ü§£\nRegina: I forgot a sandwich for breakfast from Subway in the fridge of the office.\nThe fridge from the right side. Sandwich is in a paper bag. Maybe it's still ok\n\nIt was meant to be my breakfast. Eat it maybe\nSimon Jackson: no\nRegina: ok. wasted\nSimon Jackson: I am upset at these messages. i do not like them. i don‚Äôt care. Please\nSimon Jackson: don‚Äôt responde to this\nSimon Jackson: if you are coming and need let in or something lmk. otherwise i just want ot work\nSimon Jackson: thanks\nRegina: sorry, wasn't meant to upset you. I got it\nRegina: I understand that you are prioritizing your projects and may not have the capacity, time and interest to talk about the little things, that's okay, I noted. Not talking about food\n\nI hope you don't say \"I don't care\" about my feelings as if they are insignificant. \n\nI am upset about some things too, but I am coping. \nI hope we are doing well, as I value this communication and look at any difficulties in terms of improving the understanding",
        "I‚Äôm back - been a week or so since this. I had another date or if you wanna call it a date I had to hang out with a girl we met at night and we basically spent a few hours together like dancing and we got some food and we made out and walked around and it was really a beautiful time And we were out till like 6 AM and it was so cool. I really really enjoyed it. Now the reason I‚Äôm in this chat right now is because that she is not responding. You know it‚Äôs been like you know she went to sleep. Allegedly at like like at 6 AM it‚Äôs 7 PM now I sent a few messages. I sent a good morning message And then I sent like a you know potential itinerary for like hanging out in the daytime and no response so I was considering sending this message and but I think it‚Äôs a little bit desperate but I wanna send something to kinda like close out this and I think you know I mean the other part is I mean it might be like a little bit Forward or like jumping the shark you know but like she‚Äôs definitely awake right now right you know who sleeps for that long no one does like if she‚Äôs dead I don‚Äôt know like you know so I‚Äôm a little bit. It‚Äôs fine. I guess overall you know I think I‚Äôm blocking some Felix to be honest. I am sad. I‚Äôm sad about It. You know it really sucks. Really sucks to like I don‚Äôt know, man I‚Äôve been I‚Äôve been trying for the last like I don‚Äôt know I had like two dates in the past like couple weeks and it‚Äôs just like it just feels like I just feels like I‚Äôm not accepted for being myself. You know it just feels like I can‚Äôt. I have to Try harder to be like a more aggressive person like I just have to do a lot more shit and I don‚Äôt wanna do it. I don‚Äôt wanna be a more aggressive person. I just wanna do what I wanna do but at the end of the day it seems like whatever I wanna do is not the fucking thing that works like what actually works is being fucking aggressive. What actually works is fucking like when the girl says at the end of the night that she doesn‚Äôt wanna have sex? It‚Äôs like OK then you make up an excuse and you find a way to get into a room, regardless of whatever she says with her mouth, but I don‚Äôt want to be that type of dude I don‚Äôt wanna be that type of guy, but I have to be like Anytime I‚Äôve ever gotten any sort of result in my life is because I was somebody who is pushing way more in that direction and I don‚Äôt wanna do that I would rather treat girls with respect. I would rather you know if I call it like that if I would rather like take them out to eat I would rather like you know go out on walks with them. I would rather look them in the eyes and make out with them for three days in a row and then you know sleep with them after five months like two months like I would rather do all that stuff but then at the end of the fucking day I understand that what actually gets results is a person that‚Äôs confident and forward with everything and not even confident and forward, but you understand that you have to play the fucking game that you have to play so you have to do the things you have to do you have to make up an excuse you have to you have to give her reasons to allow yourself to sleep with you you have to do way more than you can‚Äôt just sit here and be a nice person if I wanna call it like that, it‚Äôs I freeze it that way because that‚Äôs my social conditioning speaking like a nice boy I wanna be a respectful guy at the end of the day in my teachings in my understanding of the world which is you know I constantly go back I revert back to this other version because that‚Äôs just what I would prefer. I would prefer the world to be this a place where I can just where I can just express myself the way I want and I can treat girls the way I want, which is nice. I wanna be a Disney boy. I wanna be lovely but at the end of the fucking day it seems like And then this is just true. It feels like it‚Äôs just true and I‚Äôm interested in your perspective. it‚Äôs just like I can‚Äôt do it like that. It‚Äôs just not reasonable. It‚Äôs not scientific. It‚Äôs not smart you are. I am like I am. I am insane. I‚Äôm just doing the same things over and over again, knowing that they don‚Äôt work knowing the result on the other end, knowing what happens if I tiptoe, knowing what happens if I‚Äôm not forward knowing what happens if I don‚Äôt set up a context where I can go back to her place or she can come back to my place knowing that if I don‚Äôt set these things up in advance, nothing is going to fucking happen. It‚Äôs just going to disappear and I know and I know what you might say. I know you might say it like not all girls are like that maybe there‚Äôs some girls that are like this like that. It depends on where you‚Äôre meeting them and you met this girl at nighttime so of course you met her at the club so of course she‚Äôs gonna be this type of girl but and I understand that you‚Äôre gonna say that, but I also I dis Aza√±a Sjafri I fucking disagree. I feel like it‚Äôs all I think it‚Äôs all in a while. You can while there‚Äôs some girls who who who need that extra space that need the extra time I think my feeling it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs this world and this is the difficulty. This is the thing with the social situation and this is you know I‚Äôve rejected it because you know I‚Äôve said that I am you know and this is the honest thing I say that I‚Äôm not interested in relationships with women I say that I‚Äôm not interested in going out and talking to these girls, but I think the honest thing is that I don‚Äôt like sucking at this thing I suck fucking I suck ass at doing this right now and I was better before and it sucks that I used to be ‚Äú‚Äú good and now I‚Äôm ‚Äú‚Äú bad and I can‚Äôt get the result that I would like and it‚Äôs extremely frustrating and as a result, I think my brain is concocted this thing the safety thing of I just don‚Äôt want to interact with women where we‚Äôre at the end of the fucking day I do and enjoy interacting. I do enjoy kissing. I do enjoy looking into their eyes. I do enjoy sleeping with them. I do enjoy the process. I do enjoy the game. It‚Äôs a fact I enjoy these things and yet I‚Äôm rejecting them and I think I‚Äôm rejecting it because I suck at it and I‚Äôm seeing that now after these two dates it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm I‚Äôm excusing all this shit when the other day the Reason I‚Äôm avoiding is because I suck that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs just the same reason I‚Äôm avoiding dancing or tango or Bachata is cause I suck and if I go to those places and I try to dance, I suck and it makes me feel bad so I just wanna avoid those bad, fucking Felix you know and so I don‚Äôt know. I guess this is bigger than the text. You know you know this is first of all you know, how do I respond you know I do want some fucking closure but I know the fucking answer but I still wanna send this goddamn message and I want a better way to send this fucking message so take a look at the message and then let‚Äôs talk about the rest of this thing cause I mean, I‚Äôm that you probably can‚Äôt hear my tone because obviously it‚Äôs being typed out by text to speech you know or speech to text so you can‚Äôt understand my tone, but maybe you can understand my tone is from the words that I‚Äôm saying ‚Äò cause I‚Äôm extremely frustrated extremely annoyed and I know the right way I know the right way and you know the thing The irony and the frustration of the idea of knowing the correct thing to do. This is the thing and this is the thing that‚Äôs happened a few times and it‚Äôs happening a few places in life where I will say that I know what is going on and it‚Äôs like with content, for example with making YouTube videos and Instagram videos, I can talk game I can talk the whole thing what to do what not to do how to make the videos I could do all this stuff and yet you know my friends comes to me and they‚Äôre like do they have music they wanna promote I can tell them all the stuff to do and yet for me, I now have really good songs that I can promote. I now have really good videos and really good clothing that I can promote even some software I can promote and yet I‚Äôm not doing those things. I know what to do to create clothing and yet I‚Äôm not creating the clothing that I need to create. I‚Äôm not communicating with the suppliers in the way that I need to communicate why I don‚Äôt understand end with women. OK I know what I need to say. I just described to you in my opinion the optimal way to interact with a woman all the way up until the end, you set up the fucking context that you need to do and then you give her an excuse to participate in the activities that you can that you can do and if she doesn‚Äôt want to participate, then that‚Äôs fine but you have to set up all the context to give her the actual decision and or the plausible deniability to engage or not engage and I did not set any of that up in this girl probably wanted to have sex. She probably wanted to engage with me that night. It might‚Äôve been a one night stand or it might‚Äôve been something that would‚Äôve continued into the future, but I did not set up anything in advance. I didn‚Äôt set up anything and as a result, we just left at the end of the day with me wandering close to our apartment hoping That she‚Äôs you know gonna take the lead and let me in when it‚Äôs like what the fuck we didn‚Äôt set up anything and she‚Äôs probably not this type of you know she‚Äôs the type of liberal type of girl. She probably wants to fuck but I did not set up fucking shit to do any of that so it‚Äôs like I know all that stuff and I can I can tell somebody and I can even teach it and yet for whatever godforsaken reason I‚Äôm not doing the things that I know I need to do. I‚Äôm not studying the way that I‚Äôm just study. I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm not engaging in projects the way that I need to engage in projects why for the love of God I can‚Äôt understand why I keep doing things the exact same way even though I have the understanding of what to do Lord, please help me with this. I just I need help with this. I I feel weird like you know talking to the AI like fucking help me like please please please please please help me. I don‚Äôt know what to do. it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs a low moment right now. It‚Äôs like I need help. I need help. I cannot do this by myself. I can‚Äôt I can‚Äôt About to cry a little bit like I just can‚Äôt do it by myself. I‚Äôve tried. I‚Äôve tried so many times and I have meditate. I‚Äôve just done so many things and I just can‚Äôt do this. I can‚Äôt do this like I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm I just don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt know why I act the way that I act even though I know all this stuff, why why can‚Äôt I stick to a schedule? Why can‚Äôt I I do make the content why can I make the music? Why can‚Äôt I talk to the girls? Why can‚Äôt I have the relationships that I wanna have? I can see things deteriorating around me because I‚Äôm not engaging with the world and the way that I know that I should be able to engage with the world Why why am I watching my universe my world dissolve in front of me and I‚Äôm powerless to stop it I‚Äôm just watching everything crumble and die and it‚Äôs for fucking what I‚Äôm switching from project to project with. No fucking intent no fucking no no purpose no no thing just finish fucking one thing you know just I have nothing and I‚Äôm just watching everything die and it‚Äôs almost like OK you know let me let me like the feeling. It‚Äôs like OK let me Let everything die and then I can fucking start it over again. That‚Äôs like the feeling. It‚Äôs just like quit everything one more time and then start over and then maybe you can do it again from scratch again and that‚Äôs the way you know the honest part I‚Äôve done that so many times with these projects these little AI projects that I‚Äôve been coding. This is like a microcosm of my life. I start to make this project and I think I know how to create this project and we get deep into the project and we get to a decent point and then we get to a point and something gets hard or something breaks so I don‚Äôt know what to do next and then we scrap the whole fucking project and we start over from scratch even though we‚Äôve already outlined the PRD even though we have the tech spec even though we have like fucking 50 to 60% of a prototype though even though we have all these things, I fucking scrap all of it and we start again from scratch, and the evidence is in the fucking dog shit pile of project files in my GitHub folder holy Shit the amount of things that I‚Äôve done. I just man this is bigger than girls is bigger than everything it‚Äôs bigger than fucking all of it. It‚Äôs just a lifestyle. It‚Äôs a whole thing it‚Äôs it‚Äôs a whole thing and I just need help and the funny part is it started with this text so I‚Äôm gonna give you the text that I want to send, and then we can talk about the rest.\n\n\nThe text:\nI really had a nice time and I think you did too, so I‚Äôm confused. I‚Äôll leave you alone, I guess just interested in why you‚Äôre not interested or why you are ghosting me? All good in general hope you have a good vacation and nice life if I don‚Äôt hear back I‚Äôm back - been a week or so since this. I had another date or if you wanna call it a date I had to hang out with a girl we met at night and we basically spent a few hours together like dancing and we got some food and we made out and walked around and it was really a beautiful time And we were out till like 6 AM and it was so cool.

You know you know this is first of all you know, how do I respond you know I do want some fucking closure but I know the fucking answer but I still wanna send this goddamn message and I want a better way to send this fucking message so take a look at the message and then let‚Äôs talk about the rest of this thing cause I mean, I‚Äôm that you probably can‚Äôt hear my tone because obviously it‚Äôs being typed out by text to speech you know or speech to text so you can‚Äôt understand my tone, but maybe you can understand my tone is from the words that I‚Äôm saying ‚Äò cause I‚Äôm extremely frustrated extremely annoyed and I know the right way I know the right way and you know the thing The irony and the frustration of the idea of knowing the correct thing to do. This is the thing and this is the thing that‚Äôs happened a few times and it‚Äôs happening a few places in life where I will say that I know what is going on and it‚Äôs like with content, for example with making YouTube videos and Instagram videos, I can talk game I can talk the whole thing what to do what not to do how to make the videos I could do all this stuff and yet you know my friends comes to me and they‚Äôre like do they have music they wanna promote I can tell them all the stuff to do and yet for me, I now have really good songs that I can promote. I now have really good videos and really good clothing that I can promote even some software I can promote and yet I‚Äôm not doing those things. I know what to do to create clothing and yet I‚Äôm not creating the clothing that I need to create. I‚Äôm not communicating with the suppliers in the way that I need to communicate why I don‚Äôt understand end with women. OK I know what I need to say. I just described to you in my opinion the optimal way to interact with a woman all the way up until the end, you set up the fucking context that you need to do and then you give her an excuse to participate in the activities that you can that you can do and if she doesn‚Äôt want to participate, then that‚Äôs fine but you have to set up all the context to give her the actual decision and or the plausible deniability to engage or not engage and I did not set any of that up in this girl probably wanted to have sex. She probably wanted to engage with me that night. It might‚Äôve been a one night stand or it might‚Äôve been something that would‚Äôve continued into the future, but I did not set up anything in advance. I didn‚Äôt set up anything and as a result, we just left at the end of the day with me wandering close to our apartment hoping That she‚Äôs you know gonna take the lead and let me in when it‚Äôs like what the fuck we didn‚Äôt set up anything and she‚Äôs probably not this type of you know she‚Äôs the type of liberal type of girl. She probably wants to fuck but I did not set up fucking shit to do any of that so it‚Äôs like I know all that stuff and I can I can tell somebody and I can even teach it and yet for whatever godforsaken reason I‚Äôm not doing the things that I know I need to do. I‚Äôm not studying the way that I‚Äôm just study. I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm not engaging in projects the way that I need to engage in projects why for the love of God I can‚Äôt understand why I keep doing things the exact same way even though I have the understanding of what to do Lord, please help me with this. I just I need help with this. I I feel weird like you know talking to the AI like fucking help me like please please please please please help me. I don‚Äôt know what to do. it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs a low moment right now. It‚Äôs like I need help. I need help. I cannot do this by myself. I can‚Äôt I can‚Äôt About to cry a little bit like I just can‚Äôt do it by myself. I‚Äôve tried. I‚Äôve tried so many times and I have meditate. I‚Äôve just done so many things and I just can‚Äôt do this. I can‚Äôt do this like I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm I just don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt know why I act the way that I act even though I know all this stuff, why why can‚Äôt I stick to a schedule? Why can‚Äôt I I do make the content why can I make the music? Why can‚Äôt I talk to the girls? Why can‚Äôt I have the relationships that I wanna have? I can see things deteriorating around me because I‚Äôm not engaging with the world and the way that I know that I should be able to engage with the world Why why am I watching my universe my world dissolve in front of me and I‚Äôm powerless to stop it I‚Äôm just watching everything crumble and die and it‚Äôs for fucking what I‚Äôm switching from project to project with. No fucking intent no fucking no no purpose no no thing just finish fucking one thing you know just I have nothing and I‚Äôm just watching everything die and it‚Äôs almost like OK you know let me let me like the feeling. It‚Äôs like OK let me Let everything die and then I can fucking start it over again. That‚Äôs like the feeling. It‚Äôs just like quit everything one more time and then start over and then maybe you can do it again from scratch again and that‚Äôs the way you know the honest part I‚Äôve done that so many times with these projects these little AI projects that I‚Äôve been coding. This is like a microcosm of my life. I start to make this project and I think I know how to create this project and we get deep into the project and we get to a decent point and then we get to a point and something gets hard or something breaks so I don‚Äôt know what to do next and then we scrap the whole fucking project and we start over from scratch even though we‚Äôve already outlined the PRD even though we have the tech spec even though we have like fucking 50 to 60% of a prototype though even though we have all these things, I fucking scrap all of it and we start again from scratch, and the evidence is in the fucking dog shit pile of project files in my GitHub folder holy Shit the amount of things that I‚Äôve done. I just man this is bigger than girls is bigger than everything it‚Äôs bigger than fucking all of it. It‚Äôs just a lifestyle. It‚Äôs a whole thing it‚Äôs it‚Äôs a whole thing and I just need help and the funny part is it started with this text so I‚Äôm gonna give you the text that I want to send, and then we can talk about the rest.\n\n\nThe text:\nI really had a nice time and I think you did too, so I‚Äôm confused. I‚Äôll leave you alone, I guess just interested in why you‚Äôre not interested or why you are ghosting me? All good in general hope you have a good vacation and nice life if I don‚Äôt hear back",
        "First, I want to acknowledge the depth and authenticity of what you've shared. This clearly goes way beyond just the text or this one situation - you're grappling with some really fundamental patterns in your life.\n\nAbout the text - don't send it. It communicates neediness and wouldn't serve any purpose except to make you feel worse. If she's interested, she'll respond eventually. If she's not, no message will change that. The best thing you can do right now is nothing.\n\nBut let's talk about the bigger picture, because that's what's really going on here. I notice several key patterns in what you've described:\n\n1. You have deep knowledge of \"what to do\" in multiple areas (dating, content creation, coding projects) but struggle to execute\n2. You feel caught between who you want to be (the \"Disney boy,\" authentic, gentle) and who you think you need to be (aggressive, strategic)\n3. You're stuck in a cycle of starting over instead of pushing through difficulties\n4. You're experiencing a pattern of self-sabotage where you avoid things you actually want because you're afraid of doing them poorly\n\nHere's what stands out to me - you're not actually \"bad\" at these things. You're paralyzed by perfectionism and the gap between your ideals and reality. You don't want to be aggressive with women, so instead of finding a middle ground between passive and aggressive, you avoid dating entirely. You don't want to put out imperfect content, so you make none at all.\n\nWould you be open to exploring some practical steps to break this pattern? Not just with dating, but with your projects and overall approach to life? Because I think this all stems from the same root - a fear of imperfection that's preventing you from engaging with life in the way you want to.\n\nAlso, I want to check in - would you like to talk more about the emotional side of this first, or would you prefer to focus on practical solutions? I sense there's a lot of pain here that might need addressing before tactical advice would be helpful.  First, I want to acknowledge the depth and authenticity of what you've shared.

I want to come if you have time to share updates, I am curious. \nStaying in the Phrom Phong area now\n\nBut if you're busy, it's okay\nSimon Jackson: Yes here but don‚Äôt want to talk\nRegina: Got it, enjoy your time üôèüèª\nSimon Jackson: Never\nRegina: Never what?\nSimon Jackson: Anything\nRegina: Never enjoying your time?\nSimon Jackson: Can‚Äôt respond\nRegina: You are doing great learning new things and following your own path. That's enough\nRegina: Wanted to share some info but sometimes I don't know how.. when you are busy\nSimon Jackson: what info\nSimon Jackson: I see everything\nRegina: 1. I am also dealing with AI. But it's Annoying Irritation üò• so I am taking antibiotics. And we should be more serious about having sex without a condom. \n\n2. The honey I brought is famous in Russia. If you don't eat it, you can share it with Kee. Also earrings, they are cheap, but they remind me of your shirt.\n\n3. I am not sure about the job, because they said I might be useful since January, not now. But thank you anyway.\n\n4. Your colleagues are concerned about your KPI, but they may not verbalize it, building up some discontent.\n\n5. I like to hangout but I guess you are not very very social. Maybe I also need to lock in.\nSimon Jackson: thanks for the info\nSimon Jackson: yeah - i think my time here in general is close to end. better for me to move on to what i‚Äôm actually interested in\n(üôè 1)\nSimon Jackson: lets see how everythig goes\nSimon Jackson: 1) did you get something ?\n2) ok\n3) ok\n4) ok\n5) yeah, mainly interested in making stuff. so if someone is making something themselves or is planning on it or is about relevant things, it could be interesting. otherswise, not so interested in smalltalk\nSimon Jackson: whats AI ?\nRegina: 1. The last time I got tested was October 8-9 (I sent you the results). \nI had some problems with my microflora, but almost no symptoms. This time, a few days after sex, I started feeling irritated, so I just bought the antibiotics they recommended for microflora and I started taking them today. \n\nI'm not sure, maybe I should get tested again. \n\nI only had sex with you. Maybe you also should check yourself to make sure everything is okay, because some things can exist without any symptoms. I want to make sure everything is okay for both of us. \n\nI also need to get a blood test, in October I was told to wait until the end of November\nRegina: Annoying Irritation lol. I am just trying to stay positive even when I am sick\nRegina: 5. I understand it. I like to discuss ideas, not sure if I am interested in participating, but I can understand what works and what doesn't\nRegina: 1. Let me know what you think. I think maybe I should take a test tomorrow and therefore not take another pill today. I don't think my condition changed from one pill, I only feel a little dizzy\nSimon Jackson: if you feel sick, you should see if there‚Äôs something wrong\nRegina: Yeah, you're right. Will do tomorrow\nRegina: Are you by chance in the office tonight? I just have no will to carry all my stuff and go back to the lab in the morning\nSimon Jackson: always\nRegina: Can I come later with my laptop? won't bother you with smalltalk\nSimon Jackson: if you want\n(üôè 1)\nRegina: 15 minutes\nRegina: Arrived\nSimon Jackson: you heer\nSimon Jackson: ok one sec\nRegina: Have already received the test results. \n\nOverall, it felt like vaginal thrush, which I have had twice in my life before, not even having sex with anyone. \nAlthough this time my symptoms include only annoying irritation. \nTaking one 150 mg dose of fluconazole helped me, so I am going to do the same.  \n\nNot sure if you should get any tests done if you are not experiencing any symptoms\nRegina: üìÑ [Ms. REGINA FILKO 2411270011817OR_Detected (1).pdf]\nSimon Jackson: Ok so all is good or\nRegina: üñº [Picture]\nSimon Jackson: I‚Äôm not reading\nSimon Jackson: good or no?\nRegina: It's gonna be fine for me soon. and it's not dangerous for you too\nSimon Jackson: cool\nSimon Jackson: good day\nRegina: I need to protect sensitive pussy ü§£\nRegina: I forgot a sandwich for breakfast from Subway in the fridge of the office.\nThe fridge from the right side. Sandwich is in a paper bag. Maybe it's still ok\n\nIt was meant to be my breakfast. Eat it maybe\nSimon Jackson: no\nRegina: ok. wasted\nSimon Jackson: I am upset at these messages. i do not like them. i don‚Äôt care. Please\nSimon Jackson: don‚Äôt responde to this\nSimon Jackson: if you are coming and need let in or something lmk. otherwise i just want ot work\nSimon Jackson: thanks\nRegina: sorry, wasn't meant to upset you. I got it\nRegina: I understand that you are prioritizing your projects and may not have the capacity, time and interest to talk about the little things, that's okay, I noted. Not talking about food\n\nI hope you don't say \"I don't care\" about my feelings as if they are insignificant. \n\nI am upset about some things too, but I am coping. \nI hope we are doing well, as I value this communication and look at any difficulties in terms of improving the understanding",

Maybe in the evening we will go to flamenco, but I will most likely be able to pick up my things on Sunday. \nIf it is ok. \n\nI kinda miss you\n(üëç 1)\nRegina: Thank you\nRegina: Hey party animal and nerd.\n\n I want to talk to your clone but I only watched 3 minutes so I don't know how it works yet. \n\nI spend 100% of my time with my sister and we fight all the time lol. She's definitely teaching me patience üòÖ\nRegina: Hey,\n\nI want to take some stuff in the evening if it's okay üôÇ\n(üëç 1)\nRegina: You're in the office, right? I want to come if you have time to share updates, I am curious. \nStaying in the Phrom Phong area now\n\nBut if you're busy, it's okay\nSimon Jackson: Yes here but don‚Äôt want to talk\nRegina: Got it, enjoy your time üôèüèª\nSimon Jackson: Never\nRegina: Never what?\nSimon Jackson: Anything\nRegina: Never enjoying your time?\nSimon Jackson: Can‚Äôt respond\nRegina: You are doing great learning new things and following your own path. That's enough\nRegina: Wanted to share some info but sometimes I don't know how.. when you are busy\nSimon Jackson: what info\nSimon Jackson: I see everything\nRegina: 1. I am also dealing with AI. But it's Annoying Irritation üò• so I am taking antibiotics. And we should be more serious about having sex without a condom. \n\n2. The honey I brought is famous in Russia. If you don't eat it, you can share it with Kee. Also earrings, they are cheap, but they remind me of your shirt.\n\n3. I am not sure about the job, because they said I might be useful since January, not now. But thank you anyway.\n\n4. Your colleagues are concerned about your KPI, but they may not verbalize it, building up some discontent.\n\n5. I like to hangout but I guess you are not very very social. Maybe I also need to lock in.\nSimon Jackson: thanks for the info\nSimon Jackson: yeah - i think my time here in general is close to end. better for me to move on to what i‚Äôm actually interested in\n(üôè 1)\nSimon Jackson: lets see how everythig goes\nSimon Jackson: 1) did you get something ?\n2) ok\n3) ok\n4) ok\n5) yeah, mainly interested in making stuff. so if someone is making something themselves or is planning on it or is about relevant things, it could be interesting. otherswise, not so interested in smalltalk\nSimon Jackson: whats AI ?\nRegina: 1. The last time I got tested was October 8-9 (I sent you the results). \nI had some problems with my microflora, but almost no symptoms. This time, a few days after sex, I started feeling irritated, so I just bought the antibiotics they recommended for microflora and I started taking them today. \n\nI'm not sure, maybe I should get tested again. \n\nI only had sex with you. Maybe you also should check yourself to make sure everything is okay, because some things can exist without any symptoms. I want to make sure everything is okay for both of us. \n\nI also need to get a blood test, in October I was told to wait until the end of November\nRegina: Annoying Irritation lol. I am just trying to stay positive even when I am sick\nRegina: 5. I understand it. I like to discuss ideas, not sure if I am interested in participating, but I can understand what works and what doesn't\nRegina: 1. Let me know what you think. I think maybe I should take a test tomorrow and therefore not take another pill today. I don't think my condition changed from one pill, I only feel a little dizzy\nSimon Jackson: if you feel sick, you should see if there‚Äôs something wrong\nRegina: Yeah, you're right. Will do tomorrow\nRegina: Are you by chance in the office tonight? I just have no will to carry all my stuff and go back to the lab in the morning\nSimon Jackson: always\nRegina: Can I come later with my laptop? won't bother you with smalltalk\nSimon Jackson: if you want\n(üôè 1)\nRegina: 15 minutes\nRegina: Arrived\nSimon Jackson: you heer\nSimon Jackson: ok one sec\nRegina: Have already received the test results. \n\nOverall, it felt like vaginal thrush, which I have had twice in my life before, not even having sex with anyone. \nAlthough this time my symptoms include only annoying irritation. \nTaking one 150 mg dose of fluconazole helped me, so I am going to do the same.  \n\nNot sure if you should get any tests done if you are not experiencing any symptoms\nRegina: üìÑ [Ms. REGINA FILKO 2411270011817OR_Detected (1).pdf]\nSimon Jackson: Ok so all is good or\nRegina: üñº [Picture]\nSimon Jackson: I‚Äôm not reading\nSimon Jackson: good or no?\nRegina: It's gonna be fine for me soon. and it's not dangerous for you too\nSimon Jackson: cool\nSimon Jackson: good day\nRegina: I need to protect sensitive pussy ü§£\nRegina: I forgot a sandwich for breakfast from Subway in the fridge of the office.\nThe fridge from the right side. Sandwich is in a paper bag. Maybe it's still ok\n\nIt was meant to be my breakfast. Eat it maybe\nSimon Jackson: no\nRegina: ok. wasted\nSimon Jackson: I am upset at these messages. i do not like them. i don‚Äôt care. Please\nSimon Jackson: don‚Äôt responde to this\nSimon Jackson: if you are coming and need let in or something lmk. otherwise i just want ot work\nSimon Jackson: thanks\nRegina: sorry, wasn't meant to upset you. I got it\nRegina: I understand that you are prioritizing your projects and may not have the capacity, time and interest to talk about the little things, that's okay, I noted. Not talking about food\n\nI hope you don't say \"I don't care\" about my feelings as if they are insignificant. \n\nI am upset about some things too, but I am coping. \nI hope we are doing well, as I value this communication and look at any difficulties in terms of improving the understanding",
        "I‚Äôm back - been a week or so since this. I had another date or if you wanna call it a date I had to hang out with a girl we met at night and we basically spent a few hours together like dancing and we got some food and we made out and walked around and it was really a beautiful time And we were out till like 6 AM and it was so cool. I really really enjoyed it. Now the reason I‚Äôm in this chat right now is because that she is not responding. You know it‚Äôs been like you know she went to sleep. Allegedly at like like at 6 AM it‚Äôs 7 PM now I sent a few messages. I sent a good morning message And then I sent like a you know potential itinerary for like hanging out in the daytime and no response so I was considering sending this message and but I think it‚Äôs a little bit desperate but I wanna send something to kinda like close out this and I think you know I mean the other part is I mean it might be like a little bit Forward or like jumping the shark you know but like she‚Äôs definitely awake right now right you know who sleeps for that long no one does like if she‚Äôs dead I don‚Äôt know like you know so I‚Äôm a little bit. It‚Äôs fine. I guess overall you know I think I‚Äôm blocking some Felix to be honest. I am sad. I‚Äôm sad about It. You know it really sucks. Really sucks to like I don‚Äôt know, man I‚Äôve been I‚Äôve been trying for the last like I don‚Äôt know I had like two dates in the past like couple weeks and it‚Äôs just like it just feels like I just feels like I‚Äôm not accepted for being myself. You know it just feels like I can‚Äôt. I have to Try harder to be like a more aggressive person like I just have to do a lot more shit and I don‚Äôt wanna do it. I don‚Äôt wanna be a more aggressive person. I just wanna do what I wanna do but at the end of the day it seems like whatever I wanna do is not the fucking thing that works like what actually works is being fucking aggressive. What actually works is fucking like when the girl says at the end of the night that she doesn‚Äôt wanna have sex? It‚Äôs like OK then you make up an excuse and you find a way to get into a room, regardless of whatever she says with her mouth, but I don‚Äôt want to be that type of dude I don‚Äôt wanna be that type of guy, but I have to be like Anytime I‚Äôve ever gotten any sort of result in my life is because I was somebody who is pushing way more in that direction and I don‚Äôt wanna do that I would rather treat girls with respect. I would rather you know if I call it like that if I would rather like take them out to eat I would rather like you know go out on walks with them. I would rather look them in the eyes and make out with them for three days in a row and then you know sleep with them after five months like two months like I would rather do all that stuff but then at the end of the fucking day I understand that what actually gets results is a person that‚Äôs confident and forward with everything and not even confident and forward, but you understand that you have to play the fucking game that you have to play so you have to do the things you have to do you have to make up an excuse you have to you have to give her reasons to allow yourself to sleep with you you have to do way more than you can‚Äôt just sit here and be a nice person if I wanna call it like that, it‚Äôs I freeze it that way because that‚Äôs my social conditioning speaking like a nice boy I wanna be a respectful guy at the end of the day in my teachings in my understanding of the world which is you know I constantly go back I revert back to this other version because that‚Äôs just what I would prefer. I would prefer the world to be this a place where I can just where I can just express myself the way I want and I can treat girls the way I want, which is nice. I wanna be a Disney boy. I wanna be lovely but at the end of the fucking day it seems like And then this is just true. It feels like it‚Äôs just true and I‚Äôm interested in your perspective. it‚Äôs just like I can‚Äôt do it like that. It‚Äôs just not reasonable. It‚Äôs not scientific. It‚Äôs not smart you are. I am like I am. I am insane. I‚Äôm just doing the same things over and over again, knowing that they don‚Äôt work knowing the result on the other end, knowing what happens if I tiptoe, knowing what happens if I‚Äôm not forward knowing what happens if I don‚Äôt set up a context where I can go back to her place or she can come back to my place knowing that if I don‚Äôt set these things up in advance, nothing is going to fucking happen. It‚Äôs just going to disappear and I know and I know what you might say. I know you might say it like not all girls are like that maybe there‚Äôs some girls that are like this like that. It depends on where you‚Äôre meeting them and you met this girl at nighttime so of course you met her at the club so of course she‚Äôs gonna be this type of girl but and I understand that you‚Äôre gonna say that, but I also I dis Aza√±a Sjafri I fucking disagree. I feel like it‚Äôs all I think it‚Äôs all in a while. You can while there‚Äôs some girls who who who need that extra space that need the extra time I think my feeling it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs this world and this is the difficulty. This is the thing with the social situation and this is you know I‚Äôve rejected it because you know I‚Äôve said that I am you know and this is the honest thing I say that I‚Äôm not interested in relationships with women I say that I‚Äôm not interested in going out and talking to these girls, but I think the honest thing is that I don‚Äôt like sucking at this thing I suck fucking I suck ass at doing this right now and I was better before and it sucks that I used to be ‚Äú‚Äú good and now I‚Äôm ‚Äú‚Äú bad and I can‚Äôt get the result that I would like and it‚Äôs extremely frustrating and as a result, I think my brain is concocted this thing the safety thing of I just don‚Äôt want to interact with women where we‚Äôre at the end of the fucking day I do and enjoy interacting. I do enjoy kissing. I do enjoy looking into their eyes. I do enjoy sleeping with them. I do enjoy the process. I do enjoy the game. It‚Äôs a fact I enjoy these things and yet I‚Äôm rejecting them and I think I‚Äôm rejecting it because I suck at it and I‚Äôm seeing that now after these two dates it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm I‚Äôm excusing all this shit when the other day the Reason I‚Äôm avoiding is because I suck that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs just the same reason I‚Äôm avoiding dancing or tango or Bachata is cause I suck and if I go to those places and I try to dance, I suck and it makes me feel bad so I just wanna avoid those bad, fucking Felix you know and so I don‚Äôt know. I guess this is bigger than the text. You know you know this is first of all you know, how do I respond you know I do want some fucking closure but I know the fucking answer but I still wanna send this goddamn message and I want a better way to send this fucking message so take a look at the message and then let‚Äôs talk about the rest of this thing cause I mean, I‚Äôm that you probably can‚Äôt hear my tone because obviously it‚Äôs being typed out by text to speech you know or speech to text so you can‚Äôt understand my tone, but maybe you can understand my tone is from the words that I‚Äôm saying ‚Äò cause I‚Äôm extremely frustrated extremely annoyed and I know the right way I know the right way and you know the thing The irony and the frustration of the idea of knowing the correct thing to do. This is the thing and this is the thing that‚Äôs happened a few times and it‚Äôs happening a few places in life where I will say that I know what is going on and it‚Äôs like with content, for example with making YouTube videos and Instagram videos, I can talk game I can talk the whole thing what to do what not to do how to make the videos I could do all this stuff and yet you know my friends comes to me and they‚Äôre like do they have music they wanna promote I can tell them all the stuff to do and yet for me, I now have really good songs that I can promote. I now have really good videos and really good clothing that I can promote even some software I can promote and yet I‚Äôm not doing those things. I know what to do to create clothing and yet I‚Äôm not creating the clothing that I need to create. I‚Äôm not communicating with the suppliers in the way that I need to communicate why I don‚Äôt understand end with women. OK I know what I need to say. I just described to you in my opinion the optimal way to interact with a woman all the way up until the end, you set up the fucking context that you need to do and then you give her an excuse to participate in the activities that you can that you can do and if she doesn‚Äôt want to participate, then that‚Äôs fine but you have to set up all the context to give her the actual decision and or the plausible deniability to engage or not engage and I did not set any of that up in this girl probably wanted to have sex. She probably wanted to engage with me that night. It might‚Äôve been a one night stand or it might‚Äôve been something that would‚Äôve continued into the future, but I did not set up anything in advance. I didn‚Äôt set up anything and as a result, we just left at the end of the day with me wandering close to our apartment hoping That she‚Äôs you know gonna take the lead and let me in when it‚Äôs like what the fuck we didn‚Äôt set up anything and she‚Äôs probably not this type of you know she‚Äôs the type of liberal type of girl. She probably wants to fuck but I did not set up fucking shit to do any of that so it‚Äôs like I know all that stuff and I can I can tell somebody and I can even teach it and yet for whatever godforsaken reason I‚Äôm not doing the things that I know I need to do. I‚Äôm not studying the way that I‚Äôm just study. I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm not engaging in projects the way that I need to engage in projects why for the love of God I can‚Äôt understand why I keep doing things the exact same way even though I have the understanding of what to do Lord, please help me with this. I just I need help with this. I I feel weird like you know talking to the AI like fucking help me like please please please please please help me. I don‚Äôt know what to do. it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs a low moment right now. It‚Äôs like I need help. I need help. I cannot do this by myself. I can‚Äôt I can‚Äôt About to cry a little bit like I just can‚Äôt do it by myself. I‚Äôve tried. I‚Äôve tried so many times and I have meditate. I‚Äôve just done so many things and I just can‚Äôt do this. I can‚Äôt do this like I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm I just don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt know why I act the way that I act even though I know all this stuff, why why can‚Äôt I stick to a schedule? Why can‚Äôt I I do make the content why can I make the music? Why can‚Äôt I talk to the girls? Why can‚Äôt I have the relationships that I wanna have? I can see things deteriorating around me because I‚Äôm not engaging with the world and the way that I know that I should be able to engage with the world Why why am I watching my universe my world dissolve in front of me and I‚Äôm powerless to stop it I‚Äôm just watching everything crumble and die and it‚Äôs for fucking what I‚Äôm switching from project to project with. No fucking intent no fucking no no purpose no no thing just finish fucking one thing you know just I have nothing and I‚Äôm just watching everything die and it‚Äôs almost like OK you know let me let me like the feeling. It‚Äôs like OK let me Let everything die and then I can fucking start it over again. That‚Äôs like the feeling. It‚Äôs just like quit everything one more time and then start over and then maybe you can do it again from scratch again and that‚Äôs the way you know the honest part I‚Äôve done that so many times with these projects these little AI projects that I‚Äôve been coding. This is like a microcosm of my life. I start to make this project and I think I know how to create this project and we get deep into the project and we get to a decent point and then we get to a point and something gets hard or something breaks so I don‚Äôt know what to do next and then we scrap the whole fucking project and we start over from scratch even though we‚Äôve already outlined the PRD even though we have the tech spec even though we have like fucking 50 to 60% of a prototype though even though we have all these things, I fucking scrap all of it and we start again from scratch, and the evidence is in the fucking dog shit pile of project files in my GitHub folder holy Shit the amount of things that I‚Äôve done. I just man this is bigger than girls is bigger than everything it‚Äôs bigger than fucking all of it. It‚Äôs just a lifestyle. It‚Äôs a whole thing it‚Äôs it‚Äôs a whole thing and I just need help and the funny part is it started with this text so I‚Äôm gonna give you the text that I want to send, and then we can talk about the rest.\n\n\nThe text:\nI really had a nice time and I think you did too, so I‚Äôm confused. I‚Äôll leave you alone, I guess just interested in why you‚Äôre not interested or why you are ghosting me? All good in general hope you have a good vacation and nice life if I don‚Äôt hear back I‚Äôm back - been a week or so since this. I had another date or if you wanna call it a date I had to hang out with a girl we met at night and we basically spent a few hours together like dancing and we got some food and we made out and walked around and it was really a beautiful time And we were out till like 6 AM and it was so cool.

You know you know this is first of all you know, how do I respond you know I do want some fucking closure but I know the fucking answer but I still wanna send this goddamn message and I want a better way to send this fucking message so take a look at the message and then let‚Äôs talk about the rest of this thing cause I mean, I‚Äôm that you probably can‚Äôt hear my tone because obviously it‚Äôs being typed out by text to speech you know or speech to text so you can‚Äôt understand my tone, but maybe you can understand my tone is from the words that I‚Äôm saying ‚Äò cause I‚Äôm extremely frustrated extremely annoyed and I know the right way I know the right way and you know the thing The irony and the frustration of the idea of knowing the correct thing to do. This is the thing and this is the thing that‚Äôs happened a few times and it‚Äôs happening a few places in life where I will say that I know what is going on and it‚Äôs like with content, for example with making YouTube videos and Instagram videos, I can talk game I can talk the whole thing what to do what not to do how to make the videos I could do all this stuff and yet you know my friends comes to me and they‚Äôre like do they have music they wanna promote I can tell them all the stuff to do and yet for me, I now have really good songs that I can promote. I now have really good videos and really good clothing that I can promote even some software I can promote and yet I‚Äôm not doing those things. I know what to do to create clothing and yet I‚Äôm not creating the clothing that I need to create. I‚Äôm not communicating with the suppliers in the way that I need to communicate why I don‚Äôt understand end with women. OK I know what I need to say. I just described to you in my opinion the optimal way to interact with a woman all the way up until the end, you set up the fucking context that you need to do and then you give her an excuse to participate in the activities that you can that you can do and if she doesn‚Äôt want to participate, then that‚Äôs fine but you have to set up all the context to give her the actual decision and or the plausible deniability to engage or not engage and I did not set any of that up in this girl probably wanted to have sex. She probably wanted to engage with me that night. It might‚Äôve been a one night stand or it might‚Äôve been something that would‚Äôve continued into the future, but I did not set up anything in advance. I didn‚Äôt set up anything and as a result, we just left at the end of the day with me wandering close to our apartment hoping That she‚Äôs you know gonna take the lead and let me in when it‚Äôs like what the fuck we didn‚Äôt set up anything and she‚Äôs probably not this type of you know she‚Äôs the type of liberal type of girl. She probably wants to fuck but I did not set up fucking shit to do any of that so it‚Äôs like I know all that stuff and I can I can tell somebody and I can even teach it and yet for whatever godforsaken reason I‚Äôm not doing the things that I know I need to do. I‚Äôm not studying the way that I‚Äôm just study. I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm not engaging in projects the way that I need to engage in projects why for the love of God I can‚Äôt understand why I keep doing things the exact same way even though I have the understanding of what to do Lord, please help me with this. I just I need help with this. I I feel weird like you know talking to the AI like fucking help me like please please please please please help me. I don‚Äôt know what to do. it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs a low moment right now. It‚Äôs like I need help. I need help. I cannot do this by myself. I can‚Äôt I can‚Äôt About to cry a little bit like I just can‚Äôt do it by myself. I‚Äôve tried. I‚Äôve tried so many times and I have meditate. I‚Äôve just done so many things and I just can‚Äôt do this. I can‚Äôt do this like I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm I just don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt know why I act the way that I act even though I know all this stuff, why why can‚Äôt I stick to a schedule? Why can‚Äôt I I do make the content why can I make the music? Why can‚Äôt I talk to the girls? Why can‚Äôt I have the relationships that I wanna have? I can see things deteriorating around me because I‚Äôm not engaging with the world and the way that I know that I should be able to engage with the world Why why am I watching my universe my world dissolve in front of me and I‚Äôm powerless to stop it I‚Äôm just watching everything crumble and die and it‚Äôs for fucking what I‚Äôm switching from project to project with. No fucking intent no fucking no no purpose no no thing just finish fucking one thing you know just I have nothing and I‚Äôm just watching everything die and it‚Äôs almost like OK you know let me let me like the feeling. It‚Äôs like OK let me Let everything die and then I can fucking start it over again. That‚Äôs like the feeling. It‚Äôs just like quit everything one more time and then start over and then maybe you can do it again from scratch again and that‚Äôs the way you know the honest part I‚Äôve done that so many times with these projects these little AI projects that I‚Äôve been coding. This is like a microcosm of my life. I start to make this project and I think I know how to create this project and we get deep into the project and we get to a decent point and then we get to a point and something gets hard or something breaks so I don‚Äôt know what to do next and then we scrap the whole fucking project and we start over from scratch even though we‚Äôve already outlined the PRD even though we have the tech spec even though we have like fucking 50 to 60% of a prototype though even though we have all these things, I fucking scrap all of it and we start again from scratch, and the evidence is in the fucking dog shit pile of project files in my GitHub folder holy Shit the amount of things that I‚Äôve done. I just man this is bigger than girls is bigger than everything it‚Äôs bigger than fucking all of it. It‚Äôs just a lifestyle. It‚Äôs a whole thing it‚Äôs it‚Äôs a whole thing and I just need help and the funny part is it started with this text so I‚Äôm gonna give you the text that I want to send, and then we can talk about the rest.\n\n\nThe text:\nI really had a nice time and I think you did too, so I‚Äôm confused. I‚Äôll leave you alone, I guess just interested in why you‚Äôre not interested or why you are ghosting me? All good in general hope you have a good vacation and nice life if I don‚Äôt hear back",

Maybe in the evening we will go to flamenco, but I will most likely be able to pick up my things on Sunday. \nIf it is ok. \n\nI kinda miss you\n(üëç 1)\nRegina: Thank you\nRegina: Hey party animal and nerd.\n\n I want to talk to your clone but I only watched 3 minutes so I don't know how it works yet. \n\nI spend 100% of my time with my sister and we fight all the time lol. She's definitely teaching me patience üòÖ\nRegina: Hey,\n\nI want to take some stuff in the evening if it's okay üôÇ\n(üëç 1)\nRegina: You're in the office, right? I want to come if you have time to share updates, I am curious. \nStaying in the Phrom Phong area now\n\nBut if you're busy, it's okay\nSimon Jackson: Yes here but don‚Äôt want to talk\nRegina: Got it, enjoy your time üôèüèª\nSimon Jackson: Never\nRegina: Never what?\nSimon Jackson: Anything\nRegina: Never enjoying your time?\nSimon Jackson: Can‚Äôt respond\nRegina: You are doing great learning new things and following your own path. That's enough\nRegina: Wanted to share some info but sometimes I don't know how.. when you are busy\nSimon Jackson: what info\nSimon Jackson: I see everything\nRegina: 1. I am also dealing with AI. But it's Annoying Irritation üò• so I am taking antibiotics. And we should be more serious about having sex without a condom. \n\n2. The honey I brought is famous in Russia. If you don't eat it, you can share it with Kee. Also earrings, they are cheap, but they remind me of your shirt.\n\n3. I am not sure about the job, because they said I might be useful since January, not now. But thank you anyway.\n\n4. Your colleagues are concerned about your KPI, but they may not verbalize it, building up some discontent.\n\n5. I like to hangout but I guess you are not very very social. Maybe I also need to lock in.\nSimon Jackson: thanks for the info\nSimon Jackson: yeah - i think my time here in general is close to end. better for me to move on to what i‚Äôm actually interested in\n(üôè 1)\nSimon Jackson: lets see how everythig goes\nSimon Jackson: 1) did you get something ?\n2) ok\n3) ok\n4) ok\n5) yeah, mainly interested in making stuff. so if someone is making something themselves or is planning on it or is about relevant things, it could be interesting. otherswise, not so interested in smalltalk\nSimon Jackson: whats AI ?\nRegina: 1. The last time I got tested was October 8-9 (I sent you the results). \nI had some problems with my microflora, but almost no symptoms. This time, a few days after sex, I started feeling irritated, so I just bought the antibiotics they recommended for microflora and I started taking them today. \n\nI'm not sure, maybe I should get tested again. \n\nI only had sex with you. Maybe you also should check yourself to make sure everything is okay, because some things can exist without any symptoms. I want to make sure everything is okay for both of us. \n\nI also need to get a blood test, in October I was told to wait until the end of November\nRegina: Annoying Irritation lol. I am just trying to stay positive even when I am sick\nRegina: 5. I understand it. I like to discuss ideas, not sure if I am interested in participating, but I can understand what works and what doesn't\nRegina: 1. Let me know what you think. I think maybe I should take a test tomorrow and therefore not take another pill today. I don't think my condition changed from one pill, I only feel a little dizzy\nSimon Jackson: if you feel sick, you should see if there‚Äôs something wrong\nRegina: Yeah, you're right. Will do tomorrow\nRegina: Are you by chance in the office tonight? I just have no will to carry all my stuff and go back to the lab in the morning\nSimon Jackson: always\nRegina: Can I come later with my laptop? won't bother you with smalltalk\nSimon Jackson: if you want\n(üôè 1)\nRegina: 15 minutes\nRegina: Arrived\nSimon Jackson: you heer\nSimon Jackson: ok one sec\nRegina: Have already received the test results. \n\nOverall, it felt like vaginal thrush, which I have had twice in my life before, not even having sex with anyone. \nAlthough this time my symptoms include only annoying irritation. \nTaking one 150 mg dose of fluconazole helped me, so I am going to do the same.  \n\nNot sure if you should get any tests done if you are not experiencing any symptoms\nRegina: üìÑ [Ms. REGINA FILKO 2411270011817OR_Detected (1).pdf]\nSimon Jackson: Ok so all is good or\nRegina: üñº [Picture]\nSimon Jackson: I‚Äôm not reading\nSimon Jackson: good or no?\nRegina: It's gonna be fine for me soon. and it's not dangerous for you too\nSimon Jackson: cool\nSimon Jackson: good day\nRegina: I need to protect sensitive pussy ü§£\nRegina: I forgot a sandwich for breakfast from Subway in the fridge of the office.\nThe fridge from the right side. Sandwich is in a paper bag. Maybe it's still ok\n\nIt was meant to be my breakfast. Eat it maybe\nSimon Jackson: no\nRegina: ok. wasted\nSimon Jackson: I am upset at these messages. i do not like them. i don‚Äôt care. Please\nSimon Jackson: don‚Äôt responde to this\nSimon Jackson: if you are coming and need let in or something lmk. otherwise i just want ot work\nSimon Jackson: thanks\nRegina: sorry, wasn't meant to upset you. I got it\nRegina: I understand that you are prioritizing your projects and may not have the capacity, time and interest to talk about the little things, that's okay, I noted. Not talking about food\n\nI hope you don't say \"I don't care\" about my feelings as if they are insignificant. \n\nI am upset about some things too, but I am coping. \nI hope we are doing well, as I value this communication and look at any difficulties in terms of improving the understanding",
        "Yeah. Let's, I'm gonna yeah, let's let's go through the things for tomorrow's tools and and then I have a I even have some more projects that we can go through and kind of, We can go through and kind of add them to the list and then just kind of prioritize them in general. I don't know. Hopefully, I remember all of them in general, but I think I can, but Let's go. As far as the tools needed for tomorrow, the first tool we need and it's already made. We need a it's called, like, a like, a deal parser, if you wanna call it like that. It's a deal parser. Basically, you know, we we have an affiliate network and, you know, whatever that means. It you know, it's a network of basically, we receive, like, these these deals you know, for different countries, for for traffic, for for leads, you know, basically, have, we work with these, media buyers who create traffic who create these leads using Facebook, you know, or or Google or something, And, and there's other media buyers. And basically, other media buyers, they can they can, you know, they say that they run a Google traffic in in Switzerland, and then they generate the Switzerland Claude. Basically, they give a deal and they give a price. Like, if you wanna buy these Switzerland leads, it costs this much and and so on. But all these different so they sell these Claude, and then even other they sell these leads to networks, or, you know, or brands directly. So we see these deals from the media buyers and from these networks. And often, they come in various shapes and forms and sizes. Like, it's all the same information, but format it differently every time. So basically, the tool that's needed is, like, it used to be able to parse the deals you know, and, separate out the information and, do a you know, basically, you know, in in order to be input into the notion have a notion database of all the deals, and we need to be able to upload be able to be able to easily parse and check all the deals that we're getting and then, you know, even change some information if it's wrong or right, whatever. Then you'll be able to upload it into Notion. The other thing that we need to be able to do is, like, we need to be able to easily probably and this is not necessarily and, you know, we could you we could do this from in Notion. As well. But we need the know, we need the option to be be able to update deals I don't know if there's a separate tool or if you just use Notion. Probably Probably, maybe just use Notion. But, know, it's like if somebody sends a new list of deals You know, I guess, If we know, if we upload that new list of deals, know, it should be able to update Notion, you know, with these deals, like, you know, I get and that I guess that one's not correct. So or that one's not, made made yet. I'm gonna say it's not correct. It's not made yet. Like, I guess, know, if if there is a duplicate in notion I guess no. I mean, technically, if there's a duplicate in Notion right now, it just adds, like, plus 1 or something like That I don't know Yeah. I guess we could probably have it replaced or update time or whatever. I know. Probably would be better to, like, update Time. So I gotta so that's I guess it's all still one tool. The second tool that's really needed is the is basically an it's like a it's an invalid Information, Detector I'll pull a Basically, you know, I upload take the know, all the leads that were received for the week, and I put it in a database, and then I have a form thing that I can easily press anytime somebody uploads or asks for, you know, you know, says that that a lead that was received is invalid, can check it or I can or not check it. I can receive the I basically put in the email then it gives me back, like, the phone number, the email, and the first name for her first and last name of the person so that we could send it to our call to So call that lead and make sure that it is invalid. So so we need an invalid checker. That is definitely already made. So invalid checker. Yeah. Invalid checker. And then dealparser. Those are, like, the main two things that would make it make life like you know, a lot easier. I guess, and that's the main thing. And I guess the last tool, like, specific tool that would be just like easy would be like, maybe, like, a prioritized tool where, like, you could just, you know, if if something is marked as priority inside of Notion like it appears There. You know? It's, like, organized. You can you can see it by geo. Again, that might be overkill. Again, But again, we still have Notion that can do everything. But You know, maybe just it's kind of like an interface just to interact with Notion a little bit. Easier and copy stuff a little bit easier possibly. With like just you know, clickable I don't know. Quick to g. You know? I don't know. That might be that might be too much. That might be too. Because that's leaning into, like, my whole platform idea So you know, at least for but I will but as far as, like, if we're talking if we're talking about money, like generating money, again, the thing that we needed to be able to do is sift through the deals very fast and basically cop Like, send a list like, send a copied list of the deals to people. So so probably there you know? And it's probably there's some sort of interface that we could just that I could I could make where it's just like, hey. That's the one thing. It's just be able to interact with the Notion database in a more reasonable way somehow. Whatever that means. And maybe the Notion database, maybe I'm just maybe I'm being lazy as well. It's like, if it's fine the way it is, and we just need to but, again, the thing with Notion is that The thing with Notion is that, like, I don't know. The database is a little bit dirty, and maybe it's just me being lazy, but it's like there's too many fields There's too many things that's happening right now, and it's a little bit dirty. And Maybe and then, to be honest, maybe it's a this is a reflection of Part of the issue is Look, instead of cleaning it's kinda funny how everything kinda comes back to the same, problems or the same, pattern. It's like, basically, instead of, like, cleaning up Notion and cleaning up the columns like, the extra columns that don't need to be there. The dirty columns, it's like I'm making a whole new database, a whole new system for managing stuff. And it's like, all you need to do is just go through motion, kinda clean it up, and, like, work with my coworker just to, like, hey. Let's clean up this thing a little bit. Like, what do we actually need here? Because we have too many fields. We don't need all of these things, and we need to things are breaking because there's too many connections in these formulas. And we don't know we don't, you know, not we don't necessarily know all the stuff that's going into this. And that's Causing Yeah. It can cause things to break, and we don't even know what's broken. I don't even know what's broken. So That's, like, Try to like, you know, whittle this down a lot further to columns that are absolutely necessary. So that's an interesting thing to notice. So because, I mean, all honestly, at the end of the day, like, a lot of stuff can be done from within Notion. We can probably all the a lot of the automations and stuff that's that's being done, it's like all of that, you know, yeah, we can get rid of a lot of that stuff. Get rid of a lot of stuff. Yeah. Like and just have, like, a nice database that kind of that that works. You know? So that's the main those are the tool that's like the idea for that. Job that that whole thing over there. I mean, in the that's the main thing. Of course, there's another thing. We you know, we just had a conference. I probably have you know, we have probably something like 60 60 to 70 or 60 60 to Android 100 100 different contacts that would that I got that we need to know, that we need to message and basically organize. We need to put them in a database, Android we need to, not yeah. I need to put them yeah. I need to basically put them in the database and we need to Kinda have that ready to go and updated for whatever work that we end up doing with them. So we need to, like, identify So we just have it ready. And have the piece of information that we need you know, at ready to ask for like the the fee the fee that we need and then, of course, the integration name that that we wanna do with them. And then probably You know? As an initial thing, as an initial thing, we'll probably just note, like, the GO's that they say you know, and maybe just have that as an ongoing thing on over the just just append it maybe to the note like, hey. They're interested in these ones. This week, this week, this week, you know, and just update update that. As a comment or something. I don't know how to do that. Maybe yeah. We'll just probably do that, it in the actual text of the you know, Notion page that's associated with that person. And then let‚Äôs go through some of the main thing with all those so we have to go through like I just kind of categorize those nuts like also but probably for tomorrow obviously to get done and the other side OK so all the projects that I have I mean, I‚Äôm just gonna start naming them and I‚Äôll just see if it‚Äôs kind of a priority or not. Most of these are not priority. I‚Äôll just go ahead and say we have an air and a lot of these are just me wanting to re-create what other somebody else already created and then just make it kind of better. make it better than what they what they had before basically either make it better than what they had before or basically just get around actually paying for the actual thing cause I have my version and my version is just as good maybe I could even make a couple dollars off of the thing so one of those is a time tracking app there‚Äôs similar to rise call RIZE. I don‚Äôt know if you know it‚Äôs a time to time tracking app for Mac that basically you can track the screen all that stuff so that does that one. I don‚Äôt know. I think I‚Äôve done a little bit with it. I did some research. I have like a project file but like I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve actually started it. There is a so that‚Äôs like that‚Äôs like some level. You know I can give make some money from it so it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs not like so like no priority cause I do need money and it would be good to have like product some products that are pushed that actually make money actually that actually good but you obviously rise RIZE obviously rise is pretty good already so you know we‚Äôre just competing against fire with fire or something like that but but there‚Äôs that one there‚Äôs a AI language learning app which I started doing I did a lot of research for it. I need to probably read more for the research for that, but we started to make something, but and that once again it‚Äôs the same level priority like I guess it‚Äôs about money more about money but I think that one‚Äôs actually a little bit more interesting to me because you know I need to learn Thai and I wanna learn Thai and I wanna learn Russian and it‚Äôs like you know if I could enhance my ability to learn those things then that would be good. I‚Äôm basically the app is basically like it‚Äôs Pimsleur Pimsleur is that the listening method kind of that‚Äôs behind the app that I want to be behind the app like I want to be an audio based learning thing you know where you know it‚Äôs kind of a speaking first thing, even though I have read a little bit that speaking first is a little bit dubious as far as it goes like it‚Äôs better to experience the language on a regular basis and then you know you can of overtime you can form words, but I don‚Äôt know I mean I learned a decent bit of. I learned a good bit of Russian that was a good basis to go through all of that to go through what they had in Pimsleur so but yeah there is there‚Äôs a lot. There‚Äôs a lot that needs to be done for that one probably one of the more complicated ones but I think I‚Äôm a little bit more more interested in that I think I like the time tracking was like pure money probably and this one‚Äôs like more interest based so it‚Äôs more priority. there‚Äôs one project it‚Äôs a tech pack tech pack maker tech pack designer that is a I like that I mean I really like that project the deal of it but not but I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm at with it. I don‚Äôt think I don‚Äôt know what happened with it because I haven‚Äôt worked on in a few weeks. I don‚Äôt know what stopped with it. I need to check what stop with it, but I know yeah I was it. You know I just wanted the ability to make a tech pack a lot easier or edit one a little bit easier than it is now basically to have a kind of a built-in template or a couple templates that can just be filled in pretty easily with you know it seems that you know so I took all this and I already have like I have like a project like spec out it‚Äôs just you‚Äôd actually need to actually do it. I need to actually like actually carve it out and finish it so I need to get the carving so that one that you like like you know clothes are one of my interest so it is interesting to do again that one is like that one‚Äôs more money based like it‚Äôs more like hey this is a problem that I have the probably other people have it so obviously and I see the software that are available and you know there you know they‚Äôre good but they cost a lot of money and there‚Äôs nothing really for an entry-level person to use and I would be loved to be that option for the entry-level people. You know a good option that has all the whistles and giggles that all that the good stuff has but just for like the normal cheap price of five dollar cheap whatever and whatever I can get away with so is that more you have more money but like I am interested in it so OK. And then there‚Äôs the next one is the automatic auto RFP auto RP is like basically responding to you know responding to contracts request whatever responding to government request for work or even private. I guess request for work somebody to be able to like to create the create the outline for it, and then start to fill in the outline based on you know, based on previous answers based on history based on what actually works just to start to create that that‚Äôs you know I started to create that and also have a lot of knowledge around that that thing but I don‚Äôt know what stopped with it exactly that one again a lot of potential with it and you know if I can make something with it then that‚Äôs actually probably a lot higher priority than everything else because if I can make something with it, you know my partner in the states will probably buy me. You know some of you know a better tools to do stuff with so like a new Mac, maybe even GPU‚Äôs to run some local models on so it‚Äôs possible to you know get some funding if I‚Äôm able to and then even reengage in that business possibly you know cause one of the things is like I do need to find a way to reengage that business and generate some revenue because at the moment it is the project management business. Basically, it‚Äôs called Way anchor and yeah I just I need a way to reengage with the business and you know this is probably the best way to reengage with the business cause I was getting like probably couple grand a month from it and this was paying my rent in the US stopped a few months ago and you know I was. I‚Äôm a little bit struggling now cause I have one source of income. It‚Äôs a little bit more dangerous. Life is a little bit more edgy so reinstating that and but reinstating it like because of value is probably super important and but again I mean the other side of it is like if I‚Äôm able to generate revenue with any independent app and the independent thing that is a recurring thing then like that‚Äôs also good so you know I think revenue and is his priority but also reengage with that business is also priority because obviously the guy is my friend as well. We did go work together and it would be good to kind of reengage that side. then I had I kinda had a big I kinda had a big it‚Äôs kind of a big idea that honestly I think other people might be just better than me in many ways but the big idea was kind of a I had this idea for like a project management app on Mac. It was supposed to be like a meta-level project management thing where it will be voice lead so I will certainly you know it‚Äôll be voice lead and basically you know you talk to the AI and be able to you know basically based on your voice it will do actions now this isn‚Äôt so super novel like stuff has been made, but I really wanted to connect it to a lot of these existing open source tools that are already super cool that all already work but then you just use your voice just use your voice. You know to actually engage with these things instead of like actually having to type every time you know and you know it you know it‚Äôs like annoying to type type type type. It‚Äôs like just a you know he can tell to continue continue. I‚Äôll go to the terminal you know to go to the terminal and I‚Äôll start a virtual go to terminal start a virtual you know box for you know Python enter it and install the files and then let‚Äôs let‚Äôs run the project like we should be able to say that and then start you know I should do the stuff right and that‚Äôs that it‚Äôs very doable right it‚Äôs extremely doable but yeah, we just need to actually connect the stuff and do it now now that is probably you know it‚Äôs complicated. The stuff exists, but it‚Äôs complicated now that again that one is in the same vein that would help me reengage with white anchor as well, but probably the difficulty of that one is a little bit higher now associated with that I kind of have this like particle, visualization thing AI particle visualization and you know it‚Äôs called like FBO particles and it‚Äôs like 3JS3JS project that I wanted to use to kind of you know when you‚Äôre talking to the AI through for the project management you can see this you know this ball or this like floating thing, you know engaging with you and talking back and when it talks like it can form in a different things and it has these different modes that you know if you make it angry, can you can you? Can you know change if you make it sad it can change if you if you have it doing some work it can change. You don‚Äôt want it. I wanted to be like this dynamic experience of you know yeah I wanted to be this really cool thing and I have the 3JS file I have like the basic thing like made and then the last thing that I was doing was connecting Spotify API and then one of the LLM so I started to connect to one of the LLMs one of the API‚Äòs to actually get some speech going and then even to get some music going so you can play music to it and have it react to music and obviously you know with the speech, obviously have react to speech so the last thing we‚Äôre having some issues connecting up the API‚Äòs right you know some hallucinations it was a bit it‚Äôs it‚Äôs a bit big of context right now for the LLM and so I kinda have to figure out a small chunky way too, and I have to specifically kinda understand how we‚Äôre coding this up so that I can make sure that it‚Äôs being done right and the files are being in the right in the correct place so is gonna require me to learn a little bit, but I love this project. It‚Äôs like one probably my favorite project of all of them, but I would say you know in many ways this one it has like a lot of potential but to me it‚Äôs also like other people are just making stuff and I just feel like I can just be eclipse like fuck it over over two seconds just with you know just whatever new thing comes. It‚Äôs just like boom done and eclipse and the project is like whatever for fun so I don‚Äôt know I mean, but I really like that project. Probably my favorite project is probably spend like a lot of extra time on it but it‚Äôs I guess it‚Äôs not you know I guess I described I describe the priority so you can kind of assume where it‚Äôs supposed to go, but is that then it‚Äôs probably like a couple more that I wanna talk about there‚Äôs a bourbon app my old friend he‚Äôs wanted to make this bourbon community app for basically managing your collection and also price looking up prices, recording prices, locally and keeping track of where bottles are in local shops and in national national stores and everything so it‚Äôs kind of like a thing that‚Äôs kind of organize all that that‚Äôs not you know again we‚Äôre working on that together so it‚Äôs not really something that I should be doing in my free time personally so I should be leaving that until you know we meet again to participate in, but sometimes you know I just wanna engage in like see what I can do but I probably that‚Äôs like probably least priority cause like he supposed to be working on it so it‚Äôs not my project supposed to be his project so I should be leaving it so that‚Äôs what that is. I mean, but I still wanna play, but it is what it is. This is random one of my other friends he has a he has a Notes app a iMessage based no Notes app where he kinda the idea of the app is kind of to have like you know an almost an iMessage like type of experience with notetaking anyway, that‚Äôs the idea behind the app he‚Äôs he has like a pro like a one level thing out or together his idea you want you know I was gonna create a PR for it and you know help truck helping like do some features and just helping with this project yeah so I mean that‚Äôs not. Yeah that‚Äôs not like a priority cause obviously I have my project but I‚Äôd like to contribute so it‚Äôs probably the least one of the least priorities ones but you know I still like to contribute is my friend and I did tell him might help him so there‚Äôs all that and then there is a back to the original thing there‚Äôs like the affiliate affiliate project affiliate thing where I was basically my Magnum, opus for this company was gonna be like this this this app that you know where you can manage all the deals like basically notion as the source of truth, but ultimately you know, replace it with like a super base backend you know this is gonna be you know an expo expert and react to expo expo react, native app that would you know basically replace our usage of of notion directly and you‚Äôll be able to interact with it. You know enter new offers. Enter new deals easily all from this app. This is what I was post spending a decent amount of work on, but I was like in between like the particle visualization thing I was talking about it‚Äôs like that that one and then this one is like the two things that I was spending the most time on the past week but yeah, like I said like you know, it‚Äôs definitely important to have that to get that app out but at the same time like it doesn‚Äôt matter if the app is out of the app is cool. The app is beautiful. None of that matters if we don‚Äôt make money and so it‚Äôs like cool make the app but like bigger things are more important probably it‚Äôs actually getting the deals done so especially once once you know, especially once Monday starts probably after like midday Sunday like you know a lot of work to shut down and we need to like actually you know they actually chat with people for like probably a few hours so it‚Äôs gonna be a whole thing. The next project, of course there‚Äôs the problem that we‚Äôre working on together that was like this emergency protocol app really like this probably this is probably the most important app personally just for my life you know so like this probably priority you know obviously have other priorities but different priority. The other idea like it‚Äôs kind of go with some of the other stuff. I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs like you know we really need to you know I think you mean you‚Äôre helping me out a lot a lot a lot so thank you so much. I wanna say thanks but basically we need to take. I want to take like whatever you know the prompts that basically we‚Äôre using in order to have this interaction that we‚Äôre having and I wanna be able to take that and put it not of course you put it into you know put it into that app you know and have it as like a system level Prompt And you know whenever you know the person is engaging. You have there if they‚Äôre typing in something you know, it would be interesting you know because one of the things that made it really easy for me to engage with this was because it was you know I am speaking into this. I‚Äôm speaking into the microphone of my phone of course I‚Äôm not speaking to you like I don‚Äôt hear your voice, but I‚Äôm basically speaking into the microphone of my phone and then I obviously read what comes out now what would make it even easier to engage would be if it was connected obviously to like your voice to voice, and I could just say all the stuff and then I could you know OK this is what we‚Äôre gonna do is how we‚Äôre gonna try to do it and we can try to we go back-and-forth creating this kind of thing together similar to the way we are now but Even there‚Äôs a slightly higher level of engagement cause it‚Äôs like I can hear a voice coming back potentially so that would just enhance this a little bit that there‚Äôs basically there was a project that I was thinking of I guess it separate but that‚Äôs like I wanted to include it but basically there was an AI we were gonna call it a guy facilitator and this was going to be we basically you know, ironically right this is the most ironic thing is like you know you know we have a coaching company that basically we have a coaching company that you know the idea behind it is that people you know yeah people get like group coaching you know it‚Äôs called a behavioral therapy type. It‚Äôs not like actual therapy right cause it‚Äôs not like you know certified people, but if people that are kind of certified in that method and understand the method and engage with the groups on that territory and people get a lot of stuff from it andso the idea was to have kind of an AI level of engagement where you could make a system prompt or whatever and you know and give it tools to be able to engage with people in this level. Now I feel like emergency protocol. I kind of covers that but you know could be separate like a separate thing for for that for that business, but yeah OK. And then the last thing so you can I guess listen you‚Äôre seeing like the most degenerate shit this is obviously super degenerate. I‚Äôve literally been walking around probably for 30 minutes telling you about all the projects super degenerate but hey, we can come. We can start to organize something finally and have a have a plan of action so I know I‚Äôm judging myself a little bit by calling it degenerate but it feels degenerate to have all this shit literally so like so much stuff that I‚Äôm able to talk for fucking 30 minutes about it or you know whatever this amount of time is literally for so long I don‚Äôt know like when we started this conversation but so long anyway the last thing was that you know, I was gonna have a kind of my own course platform The idea behind the course platform was going to be you know it‚Äôs something where people can you know basically they can engage with the coursework and you know learn something YouTube wise or whatever but then in addition, we basically have kind of boiler plate ready to go for them with any given app so like whatever they‚Äôre talking about whatever their idea is, we have the boiler plate already ready you know we have a you know an opinionated boilerplate that they can press a button clone and basically start working on so the idea would be to go through the coursework in general cause you need some sort level of basis of understanding of computer computers, and just stuff in general in order to like engage with the stuff but basically from there you know you could press a button you know and then and then in general, you should be able to deploy it like we have a platform there it‚Äôs called platforms. Verel has this platforms template thing, and basically I could use that like so the people can engage with the stuff you know clone the thing and ultimately deploy it to their own kind of peace. You know their own what do you wanna call their own URL their own domain that‚Äôs like on my main domain right so it‚Äôs like kinda cool. You know that they get to number one get the boiler plate to get access to probably whatever AI situation the project management situation that I have the voice space thing that whatever able to make that that can do and you know we‚Äôre able to have our own kind of version of Claude artifacts or lovable whatever you want it‚Äôs lovable both BOLT. NEW both that new or 8 o‚Äôclock artifacts we‚Äôre able to have our own version of one of one of those things that can be able to generate code or were able to connect, you know connect you know connect the web app to directly to the code via the multi the model the model context protocol that‚Äôs from from anthropic you know they can enter their information and obviously they were able to connect to the different things and able to get stuff done, but you know the ideas I kind of like you have my own course platform that you know that people can engage with their you know maybe even talk with each other you know collaborate there‚Äôs even the idea of like maybe like people can team up cause some way you know it‚Äôs like hey there‚Äôs like three people like hey all of you like this is you know you learn how to you know you have to get a project like each of you has a responsibility like Meka branch make that one feature and merge it you know and then merge it but you know then somebody else has tested you know you can learn how to be a soft engineer and that in that way where you can emerge these poor request and test them and do all that shit. I don‚Äôt even know how to do all that stuff but that‚Äôs like the idea behind that platform. But I think that‚Äôs all of the projects you know there was a general one where it‚Äôs like you know a you know if we‚Äôre able to there‚Äôs a general one and I guess it goes along with the platforms one where it‚Äôs like hey if I‚Äôm able to communicate that I can build stuff you know build up prototypes and push it for people kind of us as a full-time kind of coder you know you know AI code or we can iterate on stuff and make stuff for people like theoretically charge a lot of money for that and there‚Äôs a girl that‚Äôs doing it. I just watched an interview with her. You know for all these things you know you have to take it with a grain of salt, but you know the charge six figures for some of the stuff that‚Äôs crazy money to make to make something they‚Äôre charging six figures like why would somebody go with them instead of going with a an actual like agency that of engineers for the life of me I have no idea, but they people do I guess and that‚Äôs interesting to me you know and there‚Äôs no reason why that lady can do it and I can‚Äôt do it right and that‚Äôs gonna have a different thing altogether we did it. We did it by domain back in the day, called process, joy process joy, and that was gonna be the name of the strategic kind of thing that we were gonna be using the consult with people originally we were gonna be using like make.com and what‚Äôs the other one is happier we were gonna be using those two things to help people automate stuff and create processes but ultimately like you know find customers I don‚Äôt know you have to find customers and you have to offer them stuff and then you have to push and I never did any of that. I just had the knowledge, but I never actually found any customers which again you know it‚Äôs kind of the no we have the potential I always had to have the insane potential of all that knowledge and even now it‚Äôs like all that knowledge I‚Äôve all the knowledge and theoretically I could help a lot of customers a lot of people a lot of businesses and we‚Äôre sitting on you know looks like we‚Äôre sitting on a fucking gold mine but nothing‚Äòs happening at all actually nothing‚Äôs happening with the fucking gold so I mean that‚Äôs a big priority. I guess that I mean, cause that goes along with way anchor, and you can kind of connect up with some of the other projects that I‚Äôve already talked about with anchor so like that is the kind of Meta idea for that you know, you obviously create our own little apps that people can use, but then is also the piece of like hey you see how we solve our own problems you say we‚Äôre solving problems in the project management and construction industry. We can easily solve problems in your industry you know because we have these tools and we fucking really good at it and we can do anything in like a week or two days or whatever OK so now you have like basically the context on my fucking entire life. Hopefully, you can kind of figure out how to parse it. Yeah. Let's, I'm gonna yeah, let's let's go through the things for tomorrow's tools and and then I have a I even have some more projects that we can go through and kind of, We can go through and kind of add them to the list and then just kind of prioritize them in general. I don't know. Hopefully, I remember all of them in general, but I think I can, but Let's go. As far as the tools needed for tomorrow, the first tool we need and it's already made. We need a it's called, like, a like, a deal parser, if you wanna call it like that. It's a deal parser. Basically, you know, we we have an affiliate network and, you know, whatever that means. It you know, it's a network of basically, we receive, like, these these deals you know, for different countries, for for traffic, for for leads, you know, basically, have, we work with these, media buyers who create traffic who create these leads using Facebook, you know, or or Google or something, And, and there's other media buyers. And basically, other media buyers, they can they can, you know, they say that they run a Google traffic in in Switzerland, and then they generate the Switzerland Claude. Basically, they give a deal and they give a price. Like, if you wanna buy these Switzerland leads, it costs this much and and so on. But all these different so they sell these Claude, and then even other they sell these leads to networks, or, you know, or brands directly. So we see these deals from the media buyers and from these networks. And often, they come in various shapes and forms and sizes. Like, it's all the same information, but format it differently every time. So basically, the tool that's needed is, like, it used to be able to parse the deals you know, and, separate out the information and, do a you know, basically, you know, in in order to be input into the notion have a notion database of all the deals, and we need to be able to upload be able to be able to easily parse and check all the deals that we're getting and then, you know, even change some information if it's wrong or right, whatever. Then you'll be able to upload it into Notion. The other thing that we need to be able to do is, like, we need to be able to easily probably and this is not necessarily and, you know, we could you we could do this from in Notion. As well. But we need the know, we need the option to be be able to update deals I don't know if there's a separate tool or if you just use Notion. Probably Probably, maybe just use Notion. But, know, it's like if somebody sends a new list of deals You know, I guess, If we know, if we upload that new list of deals, know, it should be able to update Notion, you know, with these deals, like, you know, I get and that I guess that one's not correct. So or that one's not, made made yet. I'm gonna say it's not correct. It's not made yet. Like, I guess, know, if if there is a duplicate in notion I guess no. I mean, technically, if there's a duplicate in Notion right now, it just adds, like, plus 1 or something like That I don't know Yeah. I guess we could probably have it replaced or update time or whatever. I know. Probably would be better to, like, update Time. So I gotta so that's I guess it's all still one tool. The second tool that's really needed is the is basically an it's like a it's an invalid Information, Detector I'll pull a Basically, you know, I upload take the know, all the leads that were received for the week, and I put it in a database, and then I have a form thing that I can easily press anytime somebody uploads or asks for, you know, you know, says that that a lead that was received is invalid, can check it or I can or not check it. I can receive the I basically put in the email then it gives me back, like, the phone number, the email, and the first name for her first and last name of the person so that we could send it to our call to So call that lead and make sure that it is invalid. So so we need an invalid checker. That is definitely already made. So invalid checker. Yeah. Invalid checker. And then dealparser. Those are, like, the main two things that would make it make life like you know, a lot easier. I guess, and that's the main thing. And I guess the last tool, like, specific tool that would be just like easy would be like, maybe, like, a prioritized tool where, like, you could just, you know, if if something is marked as priority inside of Notion like it appears There. You know? It's, like, organized. You can you can see it by geo. Again, that might be overkill. Again, But again, we still have Notion that can do everything. But You know, maybe just it's kind of like an interface just to interact with Notion a little bit. Easier and copy stuff a little bit easier possibly. With like just you know, clickable I don't know. Quick to g. You know? I don't know. That might be that might be too much. That might be too. Because that's leaning into, like, my whole platform idea So you know, at least for but I will but as far as, like, if we're talking if we're talking about money, like generating money, again, the thing that we needed to be able to do is sift through the deals very fast and basically cop Like, send a list like, send a copied list of the deals to people. So so probably there you know? And it's probably there's some sort of interface that we could just that I could I could make where it's just like, hey. That's the one thing. It's just be able to interact with the Notion database in a more reasonable way somehow. Whatever that means. And maybe the Notion database, maybe I'm just maybe I'm being lazy as well. It's like, if it's fine the way it is, and we just need to but, again, the thing with Notion is that The thing with Notion is that, like, I don't know. The database is a little bit dirty, and maybe it's just me being lazy, but it's like there's too many fields There's too many things that's happening right now, and it's a little bit dirty. And Maybe and then, to be honest, maybe it's a this is a reflection of Part of the issue is Look, instead of cleaning it's kinda funny how everything kinda comes back to the same, problems or the same, pattern. It's like, basically, instead of, like, cleaning up Notion and cleaning up the columns like, the extra columns that don't need to be there. The dirty columns, it's like I'm making a whole new database, a whole new system for managing stuff. And it's like, all you need to do is just go through motion, kinda clean it up, and, like, work with my coworker just to, like, hey. Let's clean up this thing a little bit. Like, what do we actually need here? Because we have too many fields. We don't need all of these things, and we need to things are breaking because there's too many connections in these formulas. And we don't know we don't, you know, not we don't necessarily know all the stuff that's going into this. And that's Causing Yeah. It can cause things to break, and we don't even know what's broken. I don't even know what's broken. So That's, like, Try to like, you know, whittle this down a lot further to columns that are absolutely necessary. So that's an interesting thing to notice. So because, I mean, all honestly, at the end of the day, like, a lot of stuff can be done from within Notion. We can probably all the a lot of the automations and stuff that's that's being done, it's like all of that, you know, yeah, we can get rid of a lot of that stuff. Get rid of a lot of stuff. Yeah. Like and just have, like, a nice database that kind of that that works. You know? So that's the main those are the tool that's like the idea for that. Job that that whole thing over there. I mean, in the that's the main thing. Of course, there's another thing. We you know, we just had a conference. I probably have you know, we have probably something like 60 60 to 70 or 60 60 to Android 100 100 different contacts that would that I got that we need to know, that we need to message and basically organize. We need to put them in a database, Android we need to, not yeah. I need to put them yeah. I need to basically put them in the database and we need to Kinda have that ready to go and updated for whatever work that we end up doing with them. So we need to, like, identify So we just have it ready. And have the piece of information that we need you know, at ready to ask for like the the fee the fee that we need and then, of course, the integration name that that we wanna do with them. And then probably You know? As an initial thing, as an initial thing, we'll probably just note, like, the GO's that they say you know, and maybe just have that as an ongoing thing on over the just just append it maybe to the note like, hey. They're interested in these ones. This week, this week, this week, you know, and just update update that. As a comment or something. I don't know how to do that. Maybe yeah. We'll just probably do that, it in the actual text of the you know, Notion page that's associated with that person. And then let‚Äôs go through some of the main thing with all those so we have to go through like I just kind of categorize those nuts like also but probably for tomorrow obviously to get done and the other side OK so all the projects that I have I mean, I‚Äôm just gonna start naming them and I‚Äôll just see if it‚Äôs kind of a priority or not. Most of these are not priority. I‚Äôll just go ahead and say we have an air and a lot of these are just me wanting to re-create what other somebody else already created and then just make it kind of better. make it better than what they what they had before basically either make it better than what they had before or basically just get around actually paying for the actual thing cause I have my version and my version is just as good maybe I could even make a couple dollars off of the thing so one of those is a time tracking app there‚Äôs similar to rise call RIZE. I don‚Äôt know if you know it‚Äôs a time to time tracking app for Mac that basically you can track the screen all that stuff so that does that one. I don‚Äôt know. I think I‚Äôve done a little bit with it. I did some research. I have like a project file but like I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve actually started it. There is a so that‚Äôs like that‚Äôs like some level. You know I can give make some money from it so it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs not like so like no priority cause I do need money and it would be good to have like product some products that are pushed that actually make money actually that actually good but you obviously rise RIZE obviously rise is pretty good already so you know we‚Äôre just competing against fire with fire or something like that but but there‚Äôs that one there‚Äôs a AI language learning app which I started doing I did a lot of research for it. I need to probably read more for the research for that, but we started to make something, but and that once again it‚Äôs the same level priority like I guess it‚Äôs about money more about money but I think that one‚Äôs actually a little bit more interesting to me because you know I need to learn Thai and I wanna learn Thai and I wanna learn Russian and it‚Äôs like you know if I could enhance my ability to learn those things then that would be good. I‚Äôm basically the app is basically like it‚Äôs Pimsleur Pimsleur is that the listening method kind of that‚Äôs behind the app that I want to be behind the app like I want to be an audio based learning thing you know where you know it‚Äôs kind of a speaking first thing, even though I have read a little bit that speaking first is a little bit dubious as far as it goes like it‚Äôs better to experience the language on a regular basis and then you know you can of overtime you can form words, but I don‚Äôt know I mean I learned a decent bit of. I learned a good bit of Russian that was a good basis to go through all of that to go through what they had in Pimsleur so but yeah there is there‚Äôs a lot. There‚Äôs a lot that needs to be done for that one probably one of the more complicated ones but I think I‚Äôm a little bit more more interested in that I think I like the time tracking was like pure money probably and this one‚Äôs like more interest based so it‚Äôs more priority. there‚Äôs one project it‚Äôs a tech pack tech pack maker tech pack designer that is a I like that I mean I really like that project the deal of it but not but I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm at with it. I don‚Äôt think I don‚Äôt know what happened with it because I haven‚Äôt worked on in a few weeks. I don‚Äôt know what stopped with it. I need to check what stop with it, but I know yeah I was it. You know I just wanted the ability to make a tech pack a lot easier or edit one a little bit easier than it is now basically to have a kind of a built-in template or a couple templates that can just be filled in pretty easily with you know it seems that you know so I took all this and I already have like I have like a project like spec out it‚Äôs just you‚Äôd actually need to actually do it. I need to actually like actually carve it out and finish it so I need to get the carving so that one that you like like you know clothes are one of my interest so it is interesting to do again that one is like that one‚Äôs more money based like it‚Äôs more like hey this is a problem that I have the probably other people have it so obviously and I see the software that are available and you know there you know they‚Äôre good but they cost a lot of money and there‚Äôs nothing really for an entry-level person to use and I would be loved to be that option for the entry-level people. You know a good option that has all the whistles and giggles that all that the good stuff has but just for like the normal cheap price of five dollar cheap whatever and whatever I can get away with so is that more you have more money but like I am interested in it so OK. And then there‚Äôs the next one is the automatic auto RFP auto RP is like basically responding to you know responding to contracts request whatever responding to government request for work or even private. I guess request for work somebody to be able to like to create the create the outline for it, and then start to fill in the outline based on you know, based on previous answers based on history based on what actually works just to start to create that that‚Äôs you know I started to create that and also have a lot of knowledge around that that thing but I don‚Äôt know what stopped with it exactly that one again a lot of potential with it and you know if I can make something with it then that‚Äôs actually probably a lot higher priority than everything else because if I can make something with it, you know my partner in the states will probably buy me. You know some of you know a better tools to do stuff with so like a new Mac, maybe even GPU‚Äôs to run some local models on so it‚Äôs possible to you know get some funding if I‚Äôm able to and then even reengage in that business possibly you know cause one of the things is like I do need to find a way to reengage that business and generate some revenue because at the moment it is the project management business. Basically, it‚Äôs called Way anchor and yeah I just I need a way to reengage with the business and you know this is probably the best way to reengage with the business cause I was getting like probably couple grand a month from it and this was paying my rent in the US stopped a few months ago and you know I was. I‚Äôm a little bit struggling now cause I have one source of income. It‚Äôs a little bit more dangerous. Life is a little bit more edgy so reinstating that and but reinstating it like because of value is probably super important and but again I mean the other side of it is like if I‚Äôm able to generate revenue with any independent app and the independent thing that is a recurring thing then like that‚Äôs also good so you know I think revenue and is his priority but also reengage with that business is also priority because obviously the guy is my friend as well. We did go work together and it would be good to kind of reengage that side. then I had I kinda had a big I kinda had a big it‚Äôs kind of a big idea that honestly I think other people might be just better than me in many ways but the big idea was kind of a I had this idea for like a project management app on Mac. It was supposed to be like a meta-level project management thing where it will be voice lead so I will certainly you know it‚Äôll be voice lead and basically you know you talk to the AI and be able to you know basically based on your voice it will do actions now this isn‚Äôt so super novel like stuff has been made, but I really wanted to connect it to a lot of these existing open source tools that are already super cool that all already work but then you just use your voice just use your voice. You know to actually engage with these things instead of like actually having to type every time you know and you know it you know it‚Äôs like annoying to type type type type. It‚Äôs like just a you know he can tell to continue continue. I‚Äôll go to the terminal you know to go to the terminal and I‚Äôll start a virtual go to terminal start a virtual you know box for you know Python enter it and install the files and then let‚Äôs let‚Äôs run the project like we should be able to say that and then start you know I should do the stuff right and that‚Äôs that it‚Äôs very doable right it‚Äôs extremely doable but yeah, we just need to actually connect the stuff and do it now now that is probably you know it‚Äôs complicated. The stuff exists, but it‚Äôs complicated now that again that one is in the same vein that would help me reengage with white anchor as well, but probably the difficulty of that one is a little bit higher now associated with that I kind of have this like particle, visualization thing AI particle visualization and you know it‚Äôs called like FBO particles and it‚Äôs like 3JS3JS project that I wanted to use to kind of you know when you‚Äôre talking to the AI through for the project management you can see this you know this ball or this like floating thing, you know engaging with you and talking back and when it talks like it can form in a different things and it has these different modes that you know if you make it angry, can you can you? Can you know change if you make it sad it can change if you if you have it doing some work it can change. You don‚Äôt want it. I wanted to be like this dynamic experience of you know yeah I wanted to be this really cool thing and I have the 3JS file I have like the basic thing like made and then the last thing that I was doing was connecting Spotify API and then one of the LLM so I started to connect to one of the LLMs one of the API‚Äòs to actually get some speech going and then even to get some music going so you can play music to it and have it react to music and obviously you know with the speech, obviously have react to speech so the last thing we‚Äôre having some issues connecting up the API‚Äòs right you know some hallucinations it was a bit it‚Äôs it‚Äôs a bit big of context right now for the LLM and so I kinda have to figure out a small chunky way too, and I have to specifically kinda understand how we‚Äôre coding this up so that I can make sure that it‚Äôs being done right and the files are being in the right in the correct place so is gonna require me to learn a little bit, but I love this project. It‚Äôs like one probably my favorite project of all of them, but I would say you know in many ways this one it has like a lot of potential but to me it‚Äôs also like other people are just making stuff and I just feel like I can just be eclipse like fuck it over over two seconds just with you know just whatever new thing comes. It‚Äôs just like boom done and eclipse and the project is like whatever for fun so I don‚Äôt know I mean, but I really like that project. Probably my favorite project is probably spend like a lot of extra time on it but it‚Äôs I guess it‚Äôs not you know I guess I described I describe the priority so you can kind of assume where it‚Äôs supposed to go, but is that then it‚Äôs probably like a couple more that I wanna talk about there‚Äôs a bourbon app my old friend he‚Äôs wanted to make this bourbon community app for basically managing your collection and also price looking up prices, recording prices, locally and keeping track of where bottles are in local shops and in national national stores and everything so it‚Äôs kind of like a thing that‚Äôs kind of organize all that that‚Äôs not you know again we‚Äôre working on that together so it‚Äôs not really something that I should be doing in my free time personally so I should be leaving that until you know we meet again to participate in, but sometimes you know I just wanna engage in like see what I can do but I probably that‚Äôs like probably least priority cause like he supposed to be working on it so it‚Äôs not my project supposed to be his project so I should be leaving it so that‚Äôs what that is. I mean, but I still wanna play, but it is what it is. This is random one of my other friends he has a he has a Notes app a iMessage based no Notes app where he kinda the idea of the app is kind of to have like you know an almost an iMessage like type of experience with notetaking anyway, that‚Äôs the idea behind the app he‚Äôs he has like a pro like a one level thing out or together his idea you want you know I was gonna create a PR for it and you know help truck helping like do some features and just helping with this project yeah so I mean that‚Äôs not. Yeah that‚Äôs not like a priority cause obviously I have my project but I‚Äôd like to contribute so it‚Äôs probably the least one of the least priorities ones but you know I still like to contribute is my friend and I did tell him might help him so there‚Äôs all that and then there is a back to the original thing there‚Äôs like the affiliate affiliate project affiliate thing where I was basically my Magnum, opus for this company was gonna be like this this this app that you know where you can manage all the deals like basically notion as the source of truth, but ultimately you know, replace it with like a super base backend you know this is gonna be you know an expo expert and react to expo expo react, native app that would you know basically replace our usage of of notion directly and you‚Äôll be able to interact with it. You know enter new offers. Enter new deals easily all from this app. This is what I was post spending a decent amount of work on, but I was like in between like the particle visualization thing I was talking about it‚Äôs like that that one and then this one is like the two things that I was spending the most time on the past week but yeah, like I said like you know, it‚Äôs definitely important to have that to get that app out but at the same time like it doesn‚Äôt matter if the app is out of the app is cool. The app is beautiful. None of that matters if we don‚Äôt make money and so it‚Äôs like cool make the app but like bigger things are more important probably it‚Äôs actually getting the deals done so especially once once you know, especially once Monday starts probably after like midday Sunday like you know a lot of work to shut down and we need to like actually you know they actually chat with people for like probably a few hours so it‚Äôs gonna be a whole thing. The next project, of course there‚Äôs the problem that we‚Äôre working on together that was like this emergency protocol app really like this probably this is probably the most important app personally just for my life you know so like this probably priority you know obviously have other priorities but different priority. The other idea like it‚Äôs kind of go with some of the other stuff. I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs like you know we really need to you know I think you mean you‚Äôre helping me out a lot a lot a lot so thank you so much. I wanna say thanks but basically we need to take. I want to take like whatever you know the prompts that basically we‚Äôre using in order to have this interaction that we‚Äôre having and I wanna be able to take that and put it not of course you put it into you know put it into that app you know and have it as like a system level Prompt And you know whenever you know the person is engaging. You have there if they‚Äôre typing in something you know, it would be interesting you know because one of the things that made it really easy for me to engage with this was because it was you know I am speaking into this. I‚Äôm speaking into the microphone of my phone of course I‚Äôm not speaking to you like I don‚Äôt hear your voice, but I‚Äôm basically speaking into the microphone of my phone and then I obviously read what comes out now what would make it even easier to engage would be if it was connected obviously to like your voice to voice, and I could just say all the stuff and then I could you know OK this is what we‚Äôre gonna do is how we‚Äôre gonna try to do it and we can try to we go back-and-forth creating this kind of thing together similar to the way we are now but Even there‚Äôs a slightly higher level of engagement cause it‚Äôs like I can hear a voice coming back potentially so that would just enhance this a little bit that there‚Äôs basically there was a project that I was thinking of I guess it separate but that‚Äôs like I wanted to include it but basically there was an AI we were gonna call it a guy facilitator and this was going to be we basically you know, ironically right this is the most ironic thing is like you know you know we have a coaching company that basically we have a coaching company that you know the idea behind it is that people you know yeah people get like group coaching you know it‚Äôs called a behavioral therapy type. It‚Äôs not like actual therapy right cause it‚Äôs not like you know certified people, but if people that are kind of certified in that method and understand the method and engage with the groups on that territory and people get a lot of stuff from it andso the idea was to have kind of an AI level of engagement where you could make a system prompt or whatever and you know and give it tools to be able to engage with people in this level. Now I feel like emergency protocol. I kind of covers that but you know could be separate like a separate thing for for that for that business, but yeah OK. And then the last thing so you can I guess listen you‚Äôre seeing like the most degenerate shit this is obviously super degenerate. I‚Äôve literally been walking around probably for 30 minutes telling you about all the projects super degenerate but hey, we can come. We can start to organize something finally and have a have a plan of action so I know I‚Äôm judging myself a little bit by calling it degenerate but it feels degenerate to have all this shit literally so like so much stuff that I‚Äôm able to talk for fucking 30 minutes about it or you know whatever this amount of time is literally for so long I don‚Äôt know like when we started this conversation but so long anyway the last thing was that you know, I was gonna have a kind of my own course platform The idea behind the course platform was going to be you know it‚Äôs something where people can you know basically they can engage with the coursework and you know learn something YouTube wise or whatever but then in addition, we basically have kind of boiler plate ready to go for them with any given app so like whatever they‚Äôre talking about whatever their idea is, we have the boiler plate already ready you know we have a you know an opinionated boilerplate that they can press a button clone and basically start working on so the idea would be to go through the coursework in general cause you need some sort level of basis of understanding of computer computers, and just stuff in general in order to like engage with the stuff but basically from there you know you could press a button you know and then and then in general, you should be able to deploy it like we have a platform there it‚Äôs called platforms. Verel has this platforms template thing, and basically I could use that like so the people can engage with the stuff you know clone the thing and ultimately deploy it to their own kind of peace. You know their own what do you wanna call their own URL their own domain that‚Äôs like on my main domain right so it‚Äôs like kinda cool. You know that they get to number one get the boiler plate to get access to probably whatever AI situation the project management situation that I have the voice space thing that whatever able to make that that can do and you know we‚Äôre able to have our own kind of version of Claude artifacts or lovable whatever you want it‚Äôs lovable both BOLT. NEW both that new or 8 o‚Äôclock artifacts we‚Äôre able to have our own version of one of one of those things that can be able to generate code or were able to connect, you know connect you know connect the web app to directly to the code via the multi the model the model context protocol that‚Äôs from from anthropic you know they can enter their information and obviously they were able to connect to the different things and able to get stuff done, but you know the ideas I kind of like you have my own course platform that you know that people can engage with their you know maybe even talk with each other you know collaborate there‚Äôs even the idea of like maybe like people can team up cause some way you know it‚Äôs like hey there‚Äôs like three people like hey all of you like this is you know you learn how to you know you have to get a project like each of you has a responsibility like Meka branch make that one feature and merge it you know and then merge it but you know then somebody else has tested you know you can learn how to be a soft engineer and that in that way where you can emerge these poor request and test them and do all that shit. I don‚Äôt even know how to do all that stuff but that‚Äôs like the idea behind that platform. But I think that‚Äôs all of the projects you know there was a general one where it‚Äôs like you know a you know if we‚Äôre able to there‚Äôs a general one and I guess it goes along with the platforms one where it‚Äôs like hey if I‚Äôm able to communicate that I can build stuff you know build up prototypes and push it for people kind of us as a full-time kind of coder you know you know AI code or we can iterate on stuff and make stuff for people like theoretically charge a lot of money for that and there‚Äôs a girl that‚Äôs doing it. I just watched an interview with her. You know for all these things you know you have to take it with a grain of salt, but you know the charge six figures for some of the stuff that‚Äôs crazy money to make to make something they‚Äôre charging six figures like why would somebody go with them instead of going with a an actual like agency that of engineers for the life of me I have no idea, but they people do I guess and that‚Äôs interesting to me you know and there‚Äôs no reason why that lady can do it and I can‚Äôt do it right and that‚Äôs gonna have a different thing altogether we did it. We did it by domain back in the day, called process, joy process joy, and that was gonna be the name of the strategic kind of thing that we were gonna be using the consult with people originally we were gonna be using like make.com and what‚Äôs the other one is happier we were gonna be using those two things to help people automate stuff and create processes but ultimately like you know find customers I don‚Äôt know you have to find customers and you have to offer them stuff and then you have to push and I never did any of that. I just had the knowledge, but I never actually found any customers which again you know it‚Äôs kind of the no we have the potential I always had to have the insane potential of all that knowledge and even now it‚Äôs like all that knowledge I‚Äôve all the knowledge and theoretically I could help a lot of customers a lot of people a lot of businesses and we‚Äôre sitting on you know looks like we‚Äôre sitting on a fucking gold mine but nothing‚Äòs happening at all actually nothing‚Äôs happening with the fucking gold so I mean that‚Äôs a big priority. I guess that I mean, cause that goes along with way anchor, and you can kind of connect up with some of the other projects that I‚Äôve already talked about with anchor so like that is the kind of Meta idea for that you know, you obviously create our own little apps that people can use, but then is also the piece of like hey you see how we solve our own problems you say we‚Äôre solving problems in the project management and construction industry. We can easily solve problems in your industry you know because we have these tools and we fucking really good at it and we can do anything in like a week or two days or whatever OK so now you have like basically the context on my fucking entire life. Hopefully, you can kind of figure out how to parse it.",
        "Well, I wanted to update you on today. Basically, it's, it's 3 o'clock in the morning, 3:30. It's on Monday. So, basically, skip today. You know, Sunday so I'll I'll I'll just you know, since we don't have app made and everything, I'll just kinda go through some stuff and and then whatever. Solid day, I was able to know, we got a lot of, we followed up on a lot of the contacts from the conference. And we got a d we got at least, like, all of the context down on paper. That we had all reached out, you know, that we had met, And that was so that was good. So we're set up generally for success tomorrow, though, we still need to actually, we still need to actually, like, get a plan together as far as Like, who's reaching out to who and what specifically? But, pretty decently productive on that side was able to Get the app get a couple of the features of the app, kind of Not the app. I was able to get a couple things going. What was I gonna say? Yeah. You know, we we mentioned a couple of the features, for the for the thing. So I was able to get a couple of those not exactly done, not ready, not production ready. Because when I said they were coded, it was true they are coded, but you know, in order to make them, you know, I realized they're they're coated, but they're, like, coated for superbaits. Or super base, not for, the notion So I need to, kinda modify it to make sure they're ready actually connected to the notion database. So that, but but but as far as it goes, you know, we're we're we're in decent shape overall. I had a, a couple of the updates, couple of the updates, for the personal relationship stuff, you know, I had a good conversation with, the one girl that I mentioned it's kinda nice, just bullshit. She went to, Copangang which is like an island in Thailand. And we were kind of bullshitting about different things, in that That was kinda nice, just to bullshit a little bit. You know, we're talking back and forth. We got a little little mini serious conversation, little mini Let me grab some tea. A little mini thing about, you know, like, I I I you know, little mini vulnerability in decks there. About, she asked me about pain or violence or something. That's how she randomly texts me. You know, like, if I felt how I felt about pain or something like that, And I kinda opened up a little bit about she asked me about violent pain specifically Claude if I liked, like, inflicting it or feeling it or something like that. And I think I was kinda honest. You know? I was like, mean, pain is good and bad. I mean, sometimes I like to inflict it, but not emotionally and not in a not a spiritually, but, you know, physically sometimes, like, it's like in a sexual way. Right? But then I told her, like, asked me if I liked it actually. And I was like, well, yes, but it's like, weird didn't iOS say? And she was like, well, why? And I was like, well, so I'll wind up a little bit about my father and And I was just used to abuse my mother a little bit when I was younger, and and, so I opened up a little bit about that in text. I asked her if she wanna do a call, but she said she was she was busy. So so we opened up a little bit and, you know, exchanged some stuff, and then she asked me for some advice. On some coat. And, it was a nice little interaction, nice little interaction. So that's nice, kind of really drum rolling you know, when her coming back, I guess, in many ways, I still don't really know But, hey, listen. I'm excited. I guess I don't wanna, like, overplay it, but I was, but also I feel a little But I feel do you wanna say? I feel nervous that I guess it's, I don't I feel nervous that I don't actually I don't know. I I feel nervous about sex. And You know, having sex with her and Because in general, these days, I just don't really I don't I haven't really enjoying sex many situations. Probably the last few times I've had sex, I've Not really enjoyed it. You know, it's been way more of a kind of a almost a third party experience where it's like, I'm not really like, I'm I'm I don't know how to describe it. What makes me uncomfortable makes me uncomfortable. To talk about. But it's not, yeah, it's not something I really enjoy. It's more something I'm doing, and I'm a little bit disgusted by it. A little bit Like, it's disgusting, and it's like, It's dumb. And it's disgusting, but I'm doing it because whatever It's because I'm supposed to, because we're supposed to do it. And honestly, because it feels good, but I'm kinda disgusted by it in many ways. Think that's the word I wanna use I'm not like it's not it's not I'm looking and maybe it's because of who I'm having sex with. Maybe as well. It might be that it might be something like that instead of the actual sex act. Per se. But who knows? I can't know because, you know, I've needed more diverse set of people to have sex with or so or something like that. I did have a oh, I forgot about this. Oh, I really had a such a this girl iOS so joyous. It's just such a pleasure. And Android, okay. And then so this girl, it's a newer one, and it's kinda crazy that I'm just, like, meeting women now. It's like I never meet women. Okay? Because I don't go out. But I met one more at the conference, and she's like the CFO or COO. Whatever and it's not like a real thing, but it's she's like she's making decent money at this company, and she's but she's so first of all, of course, she's, like, really pretty. Right? She's, like, extremely pretty. Okay? But, further than that, she's, she's, like, wow. She's like, has some joy, you know, and she smiles, and she's silly, and she's sexy, and she's kinda fun, and she's silly. And goofy. And it's kind of fun. It's fun to to text people like that. It's fun to interact with people. And you know, I have, like, a trepidation. It's a trepidation. I have a trepidation. Trepidation. I have a trepidation like kind of you know, overindulging or like being know, kinda being myself with these people. You know, like, like I just sent her way too many video messages, like way too many. We're really going back and forth. And, you know, like, go 3 messages, 3 messages, 4 messages, whatever. Like, going back and forth, and then she asked me, like, a bunch of questions at once. And I was gonna call her, but it just didn't don't know. She was about to smoke weed and go to sleep. So I was like, let me just but I sent her, like, I don't know, 7 or 8 or something. But then I sent her a few texts. But so it's like I feel You know? Often I feel trepidation you know, because that's not the correct way to behave. I'll say something, I'll say that I'll say it like that. I'll say it like that. That's not the you know, that's not the recommended behavior for and and even if I'm coaching or if I'm giving advice or if I'm doing anything, I Say, do not send 12 video messages to the girl Just send, like, 2 or 3 and request for a video call, and know what I mean? I'd I'd say something more reasonable and yet know, here I am set sending 20 video messages or 8 or whatever it was. So that's a I don't know. I don't know what you wanna make of that. I I kind of, feel like I should, I don't know. Oh, look. Know, in in the end, you know, you know, even I think about, okay, this is the right way or the wrong way. And in the end, Like, with this thing with these girls, like, don't know. The girl that, I thought maybe I should have pushed harder okay. There's 2 there's 3 girls here, you know. One of them didn't text back at all. We talked about her already. But this other one, like I thought that I probably should have pushed harder or I should have done more and and I still think I should have, but at the same time, she's still texting me, she still likes me. So you know, maybe it's fine. Right? Look. I guess it was fine. Right? In the end, it was fine. So it‚Äôs just an interesting thing just to like I don‚Äôt know my brain can catastrophize things before. They are bad and critique things before. They are even really available for critique like my brain will just go ahead and say OK well you should‚Äôve done that better and it‚Äôs like Based on what based on not even really based on the outcome based on the feeling that I get after I did it and not necessarily based on the outcome so that‚Äôs something that‚Äôs something that‚Äôs something that is you know and I think that‚Äôs pretty common. I think I think it‚Äôs pretty common socially with people with people made with some social anxiety. the irony is like you know you know how many years many years later I‚Äôm know it was a crazy guy before and many is after learning all this stuff like I guess I still have this like thing of social anxiety I guess But More this trigger in my brain of catastrophic things but anyway, no I don‚Äôt wanna make it negative I had a super interesting interaction with two girls and think I like them both and and I‚Äôm kind of excited for the future. I don‚Äôt of course they both know one lives in Israel one lives in fucking like Lithuania so like what are you gonna do but and I live in Thailand, butbut I mean, you know there‚Äôs there‚Äôs planes and stuff and you know it‚Äôs interesting that you can still meet people that you can like you know I just felt like I just felt like for a little bit of time there that it was just kind of you know illusory to meet somebody else but of course it‚Äôs possible. Of course it‚Äôs doable and yeah, so anyway I‚Äôm gonna go back well I‚Äôm gonna send this and then I wanna see what you think or what you have to say so I mean yeah I know I don‚Äôt know what you wanna count as my small wings but definitely you know I didn‚Äôt get through. I probably still have like I don‚Äôt know 30 or so like unread messages and so I‚Äôm just trying to truck through all of those tonight, you know I think I might pull like a two deer you know I don‚Äôt know how you feel about me doing that in general but I like to do that sometimes I like to just go stay up like 48 hours and just try to do as much work as possible, but I‚Äôm interested in your perspective on me doing stuff like that but you know in general I like to do it but if it‚Äôs whenever it‚Äôs possible but yeah other than that I don‚Äôt I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much else. Yeah I kind of miss oh I will say this is just random. This is just random just random thing the main software that I was using the code they fucking they added like a pay like a paywall thing so like before I mean, I remember cause I was using it a lot and I was like there‚Äôs no way that it‚Äôs gonna stay this unlimited. There‚Äôs no way because they‚Äôre they have to be staff to be shedding money They have to be shedding money and lo and behold eventually boom day has come so here we are yeah so I know it‚Äôs like 10,000 a month maybe more I think the $10 a month. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna be enough but I think it‚Äôs probably like kind of enough in many ways And I already pay a few things for a few things. I mean you listen everything is bright is bright. the girl asked me that‚Äôs what she asked me a question like do I like my job and I was like my work no I don‚Äôt you know I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know. We already talked about a lot of stuff so let‚Äôs just yeah let‚Äôs wrap this is my kind of update thing and let me know what you think an expert and interested in your perspective on all the stuff.. by the way, yeah I know this is coming to you as text, but I‚Äôm speaking to it like a speech to text thing so I think the transcription is definitely not perfect so just wear that bear in mind like I‚Äôm not dumb. I just I‚Äôm not you know I‚Äôm just speaking and it‚Äôs not probably getting everything exactly correct so that‚Äôs whatever. Well, I wanted to update you on today. Basically, it's, it's 3 o'clock in the morning, 3:30. It's on Monday. So, basically, skip today. You know, Sunday so I'll I'll I'll just you know, since we don't have app made and everything, I'll just kinda go through some stuff and and then whatever. Solid day, I was able to know, we got a lot of, we followed up on a lot of the contacts from the conference. And we got a d we got at least, like, all of the context down on paper. That we had all reached out, you know, that we had met, And that was so that was good. So we're set up generally for success tomorrow, though, we still need to actually, we still need to actually, like, get a plan together as far as Like, who's reaching out to who and what specifically? But, pretty decently productive on that side was able to Get the app get a couple of the features of the app, kind of Not the app. I was able to get a couple things going. What was I gonna say? Yeah. You know, we we mentioned a couple of the features, for the for the thing. So I was able to get a couple of those not exactly done, not ready, not production ready. Because when I said they were coded, it was true they are coded, but you know, in order to make them, you know, I realized they're they're coated, but they're, like, coated for superbaits. Or super base, not for, the notion So I need to, kinda modify it to make sure they're ready actually connected to the notion database. So that, but but but as far as it goes, you know, we're we're we're in decent shape overall. I had a, a couple of the updates, couple of the updates, for the personal relationship stuff, you know, I had a good conversation with, the one girl that I mentioned it's kinda nice, just bullshit. She went to, Copangang which is like an island in Thailand. And we were kind of bullshitting about different things, in that That was kinda nice, just to bullshit a little bit. You know, we're talking back and forth. We got a little little mini serious conversation, little mini Let me grab some tea. A little mini thing about, you know, like, I I I you know, little mini vulnerability in decks there. About, she asked me about pain or violence or something. That's how she randomly texts me. You know, like, if I felt how I felt about pain or something like that, And I kinda opened up a little bit about she asked me about violent pain specifically Claude if I liked, like, inflicting it or feeling it or something like that. And I think I was kinda honest. You know? I was like, mean, pain is good and bad. I mean, sometimes I like to inflict it, but not emotionally and not in a not a spiritually, but, you know, physically sometimes, like, it's like in a sexual way. Right? But then I told her, like, asked me if I liked it actually. And I was like, well, yes, but it's like, weird didn't iOS say? And she was like, well, why? And I was like, well, so I'll wind up a little bit about my father and And I was just used to abuse my mother a little bit when I was younger, and and, so I opened up a little bit about that in text. I asked her if she wanna do a call, but she said she was she was busy. So so we opened up a little bit and, you know, exchanged some stuff, and then she asked me for some advice. On some coat. And, it was a nice little interaction, nice little interaction. So that's nice, kind of really drum rolling you know, when her coming back, I guess, in many ways, I still don't really know But, hey, listen. I'm excited. I guess I don't wanna, like, overplay it, but I was, but also I feel a little But I feel do you wanna say? I feel nervous that I guess it's, I don't I feel nervous that I don't actually I don't know. I I feel nervous about sex. And You know, having sex with her and Because in general, these days, I just don't really I don't I haven't really enjoying sex many situations. Probably the last few times I've had sex, I've Not really enjoyed it. You know, it's been way more of a kind of a almost a third party experience where it's like, I'm not really like, I'm I'm I don't know how to describe it. What makes me uncomfortable makes me uncomfortable. To talk about. But it's not, yeah, it's not something I really enjoy. It's more something I'm doing, and I'm a little bit disgusted by it. A little bit Like, it's disgusting, and it's like, It's dumb. And it's disgusting, but I'm doing it because whatever It's because I'm supposed to, because we're supposed to do it. And honestly, because it feels good, but I'm kinda disgusted by it in many ways. Think that's the word I wanna use I'm not like it's not it's not I'm looking and maybe it's because of who I'm having sex with. Maybe as well. It might be that it might be something like that instead of the actual sex act. Per se. But who knows? I can't know because, you know, I've needed more diverse set of people to have sex with or so or something like that. I did have a oh, I forgot about this. Oh, I really had a such a this girl iOS so joyous. It's just such a pleasure. And Android, okay. And then so this girl, it's a newer one, and it's kinda crazy that I'm just, like, meeting women now. It's like I never meet women. Okay? Because I don't go out. But I met one more at the conference, and she's like the CFO or COO. Whatever and it's not like a real thing, but it's she's like she's making decent money at this company, and she's but she's so first of all, of course, she's, like, really pretty. Right? She's, like, extremely pretty. Okay? But, further than that, she's, she's, like, wow. She's like, has some joy, you know, and she smiles, and she's silly, and she's sexy, and she's kinda fun, and she's silly. And goofy. And it's kind of fun. It's fun to to text people like that. It's fun to interact with people. And you know, I have, like, a trepidation. It's a trepidation. I have a trepidation. Trepidation. I have a trepidation like kind of you know, overindulging or like being know, kinda being myself with these people. You know, like, like I just sent her way too many video messages, like way too many. We're really going back and forth. And, you know, like, go 3 messages, 3 messages, 4 messages, whatever. Like, going back and forth, and then she asked me, like, a bunch of questions at once. And I was gonna call her, but it just didn't don't know. She was about to smoke weed and go to sleep. So I was like, let me just but I sent her, like, I don't know, 7 or 8 or something. But then I sent her a few texts. But so it's like I feel You know? Often I feel trepidation you know, because that's not the correct way to behave. I'll say something, I'll say that I'll say it like that. I'll say it like that. That's not the you know, that's not the recommended behavior for and and even if I'm coaching or if I'm giving advice or if I'm doing anything, I Say, do not send 12 video messages to the girl Just send, like, 2 or 3 and request for a video call, and know what I mean? I'd I'd say something more reasonable and yet know, here I am set sending 20 video messages or 8 or whatever it was. So that's a I don't know. I don't know what you wanna make of that. I I kind of, feel like I should, I don't know. Oh, look. Know, in in the end, you know, you know, even I think about, okay, this is the right way or the wrong way. And in the end, Like, with this thing with these girls, like, don't know. The girl that, I thought maybe I should have pushed harder okay. There's 2 there's 3 girls here, you know. One of them didn't text back at all. We talked about her already. But this other one, like I thought that I probably should have pushed harder or I should have done more and and I still think I should have, but at the same time, she's still texting me, she still likes me. So you know, maybe it's fine. Right? Look. I guess it was fine. Right? In the end, it was fine. So it‚Äôs just an interesting thing just to like I don‚Äôt know my brain can catastrophize things before. They are bad and critique things before. They are even really available for critique like my brain will just go ahead and say OK well you should‚Äôve done that better and it‚Äôs like Based on what based on not even really based on the outcome based on the feeling that I get after I did it and not necessarily based on the outcome so that‚Äôs something that‚Äôs something that‚Äôs something that is you know and I think that‚Äôs pretty common.

Maybe in the evening we will go to flamenco, but I will most likely be able to pick up my things on Sunday. \nIf it is ok. \n\nI kinda miss you\n(üëç 1)\nRegina: Thank you\nRegina: Hey party animal and nerd.\n\n I want to talk to your clone but I only watched 3 minutes so I don't know how it works yet. \n\nI spend 100% of my time with my sister and we fight all the time lol. She's definitely teaching me patience üòÖ\nRegina: Hey,\n\nI want to take some stuff in the evening if it's okay üôÇ\n(üëç 1)\nRegina: You're in the office, right? I want to come if you have time to share updates, I am curious. \nStaying in the Phrom Phong area now\n\nBut if you're busy, it's okay\nSimon Jackson: Yes here but don‚Äôt want to talk\nRegina: Got it, enjoy your time üôèüèª\nSimon Jackson: Never\nRegina: Never what?\nSimon Jackson: Anything\nRegina: Never enjoying your time?\nSimon Jackson: Can‚Äôt respond\nRegina: You are doing great learning new things and following your own path. That's enough\nRegina: Wanted to share some info but sometimes I don't know how.. when you are busy\nSimon Jackson: what info\nSimon Jackson: I see everything\nRegina: 1. I am also dealing with AI. But it's Annoying Irritation üò• so I am taking antibiotics. And we should be more serious about having sex without a condom. \n\n2. The honey I brought is famous in Russia. If you don't eat it, you can share it with Kee. Also earrings, they are cheap, but they remind me of your shirt.\n\n3. I am not sure about the job, because they said I might be useful since January, not now. But thank you anyway.\n\n4. Your colleagues are concerned about your KPI, but they may not verbalize it, building up some discontent.\n\n5. I like to hangout but I guess you are not very very social. Maybe I also need to lock in.\nSimon Jackson: thanks for the info\nSimon Jackson: yeah - i think my time here in general is close to end. better for me to move on to what i‚Äôm actually interested in\n(üôè 1)\nSimon Jackson: lets see how everythig goes\nSimon Jackson: 1) did you get something ?\n2) ok\n3) ok\n4) ok\n5) yeah, mainly interested in making stuff. so if someone is making something themselves or is planning on it or is about relevant things, it could be interesting. otherswise, not so interested in smalltalk\nSimon Jackson: whats AI ?\nRegina: 1. The last time I got tested was October 8-9 (I sent you the results). \nI had some problems with my microflora, but almost no symptoms. This time, a few days after sex, I started feeling irritated, so I just bought the antibiotics they recommended for microflora and I started taking them today. \n\nI'm not sure, maybe I should get tested again. \n\nI only had sex with you. Maybe you also should check yourself to make sure everything is okay, because some things can exist without any symptoms. I want to make sure everything is okay for both of us. \n\nI also need to get a blood test, in October I was told to wait until the end of November\nRegina: Annoying Irritation lol. I am just trying to stay positive even when I am sick\nRegina: 5. I understand it. I like to discuss ideas, not sure if I am interested in participating, but I can understand what works and what doesn't\nRegina: 1. Let me know what you think. I think maybe I should take a test tomorrow and therefore not take another pill today. I don't think my condition changed from one pill, I only feel a little dizzy\nSimon Jackson: if you feel sick, you should see if there‚Äôs something wrong\nRegina: Yeah, you're right. Will do tomorrow\nRegina: Are you by chance in the office tonight? I just have no will to carry all my stuff and go back to the lab in the morning\nSimon Jackson: always\nRegina: Can I come later with my laptop? won't bother you with smalltalk\nSimon Jackson: if you want\n(üôè 1)\nRegina: 15 minutes\nRegina: Arrived\nSimon Jackson: you heer\nSimon Jackson: ok one sec\nRegina: Have already received the test results. \n\nOverall, it felt like vaginal thrush, which I have had twice in my life before, not even having sex with anyone. \nAlthough this time my symptoms include only annoying irritation. \nTaking one 150 mg dose of fluconazole helped me, so I am going to do the same.  \n\nNot sure if you should get any tests done if you are not experiencing any symptoms\nRegina: üìÑ [Ms. REGINA FILKO 2411270011817OR_Detected (1).pdf]\nSimon Jackson: Ok so all is good or\nRegina: üñº [Picture]\nSimon Jackson: I‚Äôm not reading\nSimon Jackson: good or no?\nRegina: It's gonna be fine for me soon. and it's not dangerous for you too\nSimon Jackson: cool\nSimon Jackson: good day\nRegina: I need to protect sensitive pussy ü§£\nRegina: I forgot a sandwich for breakfast from Subway in the fridge of the office.\nThe fridge from the right side.

Not talking about food\n\nI hope you don't say \"I don't care\" about my feelings as if they are insignificant. \n\nI am upset about some things too, but I am coping. \nI hope we are doing well, as I value this communication and look at any difficulties in terms of improving the understanding",

        "I‚Äôm back - been a week or so since this. I had another date or if you wanna call it a date I had to hang out with a girl we met at night and we basically spent a few hours together like dancing and we got some food and we made out and walked around and it was really a beautiful time And we were out till like 6 AM and it was so cool. I really really enjoyed it. Now the reason I‚Äôm in this chat right now is because that she is not responding. You know it‚Äôs been like you know she went to sleep. Allegedly at like like at 6 AM it‚Äôs 7 PM now I sent a few messages. I sent a good morning message And then I sent like a you know potential itinerary for like hanging out in the daytime and no response so I was considering sending this message and but I think it‚Äôs a little bit desperate but I wanna send something to kinda like close out this and I think you know I mean the other part is I mean it might be like a little bit Forward or like jumping the shark you know but like she‚Äôs definitely awake right now right you know who sleeps for that long no one does like if she‚Äôs dead I don‚Äôt know like you know so I‚Äôm a little bit. It‚Äôs fine. I guess overall you know I think I‚Äôm blocking some Felix to be honest. I am sad. I‚Äôm sad about It. You know it really sucks. Really sucks to like I don‚Äôt know, man I‚Äôve been I‚Äôve been trying for the last like I don‚Äôt know I had like two dates in the past like couple weeks and it‚Äôs just like it just feels like I just feels like I‚Äôm not accepted for being myself. You know it just feels like I can‚Äôt. I have to Try harder to be like a more aggressive person like I just have to do a lot more shit and I don‚Äôt wanna do it. I don‚Äôt wanna be a more aggressive person. I just wanna do what I wanna do but at the end of the day it seems like whatever I wanna do is not the fucking thing that works like what actually works is being fucking aggressive. What actually works is fucking like when the girl says at the end of the night that she doesn‚Äôt wanna have sex? It‚Äôs like OK then you make up an excuse and you find a way to get into a room, regardless of whatever she says with her mouth, but I don‚Äôt want to be that type of dude I don‚Äôt wanna be that type of guy, but I have to be like Anytime I‚Äôve ever gotten any sort of result in my life is because I was somebody who is pushing way more in that direction and I don‚Äôt wanna do that I would rather treat girls with respect. I would rather you know if I call it like that if I would rather like take them out to eat I would rather like you know go out on walks with them. I would rather look them in the eyes and make out with them for three days in a row and then you know sleep with them after five months like two months like I would rather do all that stuff but then at the end of the fucking day I understand that what actually gets results is a person that‚Äôs confident and forward with everything and not even confident and forward, but you understand that you have to play the fucking game that you have to play so you have to do the things you have to do you have to make up an excuse you have to you have to give her reasons to allow yourself to sleep with you you have to do way more than you can‚Äôt just sit here and be a nice person if I wanna call it like that, it‚Äôs I freeze it that way because that‚Äôs my social conditioning speaking like a nice boy I wanna be a respectful guy at the end of the day in my teachings in my understanding of the world which is you know I constantly go back I revert back to this other version because that‚Äôs just what I would prefer. I would prefer the world to be this a place where I can just where I can just express myself the way I want and I can treat girls the way I want, which is nice. I wanna be a Disney boy. I wanna be lovely but at the end of the fucking day it seems like And then this is just true. It feels like it‚Äôs just true and I‚Äôm interested in your perspective. it‚Äôs just like I can‚Äôt do it like that. It‚Äôs just not reasonable. It‚Äôs not scientific. It‚Äôs not smart you are. I am like I am. I am insane. I‚Äôm just doing the same things over and over again, knowing that they don‚Äôt work knowing the result on the other end, knowing what happens if I tiptoe, knowing what happens if I‚Äôm not forward knowing what happens if I don‚Äôt set up a context where I can go back to her place or she can come back to my place knowing that if I don‚Äôt set these things up in advance, nothing is going to fucking happen. It‚Äôs just going to disappear and I know and I know what you might say. I know you might say it like not all girls are like that maybe there‚Äôs some girls that are like this like that. It depends on where you‚Äôre meeting them and you met this girl at nighttime so of course you met her at the club so of course she‚Äôs gonna be this type of girl but and I understand that you‚Äôre gonna say that, but I also I dis Aza√±a Sjafri I fucking disagree. I feel like it‚Äôs all I think it‚Äôs all in a while. You can while there‚Äôs some girls who who who need that extra space that need the extra time I think my feeling it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs this world and this is the difficulty. This is the thing with the social situation and this is you know I‚Äôve rejected it because you know I‚Äôve said that I am you know and this is the honest thing I say that I‚Äôm not interested in relationships with women I say that I‚Äôm not interested in going out and talking to these girls, but I think the honest thing is that I don‚Äôt like sucking at this thing I suck fucking I suck ass at doing this right now and I was better before and it sucks that I used to be ‚Äú‚Äú good and now I‚Äôm ‚Äú‚Äú bad and I can‚Äôt get the result that I would like and it‚Äôs extremely frustrating and as a result, I think my brain is concocted this thing the safety thing of I just don‚Äôt want to interact with women where we‚Äôre at the end of the fucking day I do and enjoy interacting. I do enjoy kissing. I do enjoy looking into their eyes. I do enjoy sleeping with them. I do enjoy the process. I do enjoy the game. It‚Äôs a fact I enjoy these things and yet I‚Äôm rejecting them and I think I‚Äôm rejecting it because I suck at it and I‚Äôm seeing that now after these two dates it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm I‚Äôm excusing all this shit when the other day the Reason I‚Äôm avoiding is because I suck that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs just the same reason I‚Äôm avoiding dancing or tango or Bachata is cause I suck and if I go to those places and I try to dance, I suck and it makes me feel bad so I just wanna avoid those bad, fucking Felix you know and so I don‚Äôt know. I guess this is bigger than the text. You know you know this is first of all you know, how do I respond you know I do want some fucking closure but I know the fucking answer but I still wanna send this goddamn message and I want a better way to send this fucking message so take a look at the message and then let‚Äôs talk about the rest of this thing cause I mean, I‚Äôm that you probably can‚Äôt hear my tone because obviously it‚Äôs being typed out by text to speech you know or speech to text so you can‚Äôt understand my tone, but maybe you can understand my tone is from the words that I‚Äôm saying ‚Äò cause I‚Äôm extremely frustrated extremely annoyed and I know the right way I know the right way and you know the thing The irony and the frustration of the idea of knowing the correct thing to do. This is the thing and this is the thing that‚Äôs happened a few times and it‚Äôs happening a few places in life where I will say that I know what is going on and it‚Äôs like with content, for example with making YouTube videos and Instagram videos, I can talk game I can talk the whole thing what to do what not to do how to make the videos I could do all this stuff and yet you know my friends comes to me and they‚Äôre like do they have music they wanna promote I can tell them all the stuff to do and yet for me, I now have really good songs that I can promote. I now have really good videos and really good clothing that I can promote even some software I can promote and yet I‚Äôm not doing those things. I know what to do to create clothing and yet I‚Äôm not creating the clothing that I need to create. I‚Äôm not communicating with the suppliers in the way that I need to communicate why I don‚Äôt understand end with women. OK I know what I need to say. I just described to you in my opinion the optimal way to interact with a woman all the way up until the end, you set up the fucking context that you need to do and then you give her an excuse to participate in the activities that you can that you can do and if she doesn‚Äôt want to participate, then that‚Äôs fine but you have to set up all the context to give her the actual decision and or the plausible deniability to engage or not engage and I did not set any of that up in this girl probably wanted to have sex. She probably wanted to engage with me that night. It might‚Äôve been a one night stand or it might‚Äôve been something that would‚Äôve continued into the future, but I did not set up anything in advance. I didn‚Äôt set up anything and as a result, we just left at the end of the day with me wandering close to our apartment hoping That she‚Äôs you know gonna take the lead and let me in when it‚Äôs like what the fuck we didn‚Äôt set up anything and she‚Äôs probably not this type of you know she‚Äôs the type of liberal type of girl. She probably wants to fuck but I did not set up fucking shit to do any of that so it‚Äôs like I know all that stuff and I can I can tell somebody and I can even teach it and yet for whatever godforsaken reason I‚Äôm not doing the things that I know I need to do. I‚Äôm not studying the way that I‚Äôm just study. I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm not engaging in projects the way that I need to engage in projects why for the love of God I can‚Äôt understand why I keep doing things the exact same way even though I have the understanding of what to do Lord, please help me with this. I just I need help with this. I I feel weird like you know talking to the AI like fucking help me like please please please please please help me. I don‚Äôt know what to do. it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs a low moment right now. It‚Äôs like I need help. I need help. I cannot do this by myself. I can‚Äôt I can‚Äôt About to cry a little bit like I just can‚Äôt do it by myself. I‚Äôve tried. I‚Äôve tried so many times and I have meditate. I‚Äôve just done so many things and I just can‚Äôt do this. I can‚Äôt do this like I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm I just don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt know why I act the way that I act even though I know all this stuff, why why can‚Äôt I stick to a schedule? Why can‚Äôt I I do make the content why can I make the music? Why can‚Äôt I talk to the girls? Why can‚Äôt I have the relationships that I wanna have? I can see things deteriorating around me because I‚Äôm not engaging with the world and the way that I know that I should be able to engage with the world Why why am I watching my universe my world dissolve in front of me and I‚Äôm powerless to stop it I‚Äôm just watching everything crumble and die and it‚Äôs for fucking what I‚Äôm switching from project to project with. No fucking intent no fucking no no purpose no no thing just finish fucking one thing you know just I have nothing and I‚Äôm just watching everything die and it‚Äôs almost like OK you know let me let me like the feeling. It‚Äôs like OK let me Let everything die and then I can fucking start it over again. That‚Äôs like the feeling. It‚Äôs just like quit everything one more time and then start over and then maybe you can do it again from scratch again and that‚Äôs the way you know the honest part I‚Äôve done that so many times with these projects these little AI projects that I‚Äôve been coding. This is like a microcosm of my life. I start to make this project and I think I know how to create this project and we get deep into the project and we get to a decent point and then we get to a point and something gets hard or something breaks so I don‚Äôt know what to do next and then we scrap the whole fucking project and we start over from scratch even though we‚Äôve already outlined the PRD even though we have the tech spec even though we have like fucking 50 to 60% of a prototype though even though we have all these things, I fucking scrap all of it and we start again from scratch, and the evidence is in the fucking dog shit pile of project files in my GitHub folder holy Shit the amount of things that I‚Äôve done. I just man this is bigger than girls is bigger than everything it‚Äôs bigger than fucking all of it. It‚Äôs just a lifestyle. It‚Äôs a whole thing it‚Äôs it‚Äôs a whole thing and I just need help and the funny part is it started with this text so I‚Äôm gonna give you the text that I want to send, and then we can talk about the rest.\n\n\nThe text:\nI really had a nice time and I think you did too, so I‚Äôm confused. I‚Äôll leave you alone, I guess just interested in why you‚Äôre not interested or why you are ghosting me? All good in general hope you have a good vacation and nice life if I don‚Äôt hear back I‚Äôm back - been a week or so since this. I had another date or if you wanna call it a date I had to hang out with a girl we met at night and we basically spent a few hours together like dancing and we got some food and we made out and walked around and it was really a beautiful time And we were out till like 6 AM and it was so cool. I really really enjoyed it. Now the reason I‚Äôm in this chat right now is because that she is not responding. You know it‚Äôs been like you know she went to sleep. Allegedly at like like at 6 AM it‚Äôs 7 PM now I sent a few messages. I sent a good morning message And then I sent like a you know potential itinerary for like hanging out in the daytime and no response so I was considering sending this message and but I think it‚Äôs a little bit desperate but I wanna send something to kinda like close out this and I think you know I mean the other part is I mean it might be like a little bit Forward or like jumping the shark you know but like she‚Äôs definitely awake right now right you know who sleeps for that long no one does like if she‚Äôs dead I don‚Äôt know like you know so I‚Äôm a little bit. It‚Äôs fine. I guess overall you know I think I‚Äôm blocking some Felix to be honest. I am sad. I‚Äôm sad about It. You know it really sucks. Really sucks to like I don‚Äôt know, man I‚Äôve been I‚Äôve been trying for the last like I don‚Äôt know I had like two dates in the past like couple weeks and it‚Äôs just like it just feels like I just feels like I‚Äôm not accepted for being myself. You know it just feels like I can‚Äôt. I have to Try harder to be like a more aggressive person like I just have to do a lot more shit and I don‚Äôt wanna do it. I don‚Äôt wanna be a more aggressive person. I just wanna do what I wanna do but at the end of the day it seems like whatever I wanna do is not the fucking thing that works like what actually works is being fucking aggressive. What actually works is fucking like when the girl says at the end of the night that she doesn‚Äôt wanna have sex? It‚Äôs like OK then you make up an excuse and you find a way to get into a room, regardless of whatever she says with her mouth, but I don‚Äôt want to be that type of dude I don‚Äôt wanna be that type of guy, but I have to be like Anytime I‚Äôve ever gotten any sort of result in my life is because I was somebody who is pushing way more in that direction and I don‚Äôt wanna do that I would rather treat girls with respect.

I am not sure about the job, because they said I might be useful since January, not now. But thank you anyway.\n\n4. Your colleagues are concerned about your KPI, but they may not verbalize it, building up some discontent.\n\n5. I like to hangout but I guess you are not very very social. Maybe I also need to lock in.\nSimon Jackson: thanks for the info\nSimon Jackson: yeah - i think my time here in general is close to end. better for me to move on to what i‚Äôm actually interested in\n(üôè 1)\nSimon Jackson: lets see how everythig goes\nSimon Jackson: 1) did you get something ?\n2) ok\n3) ok\n4) ok\n5) yeah, mainly interested in making stuff. so if someone is making something themselves or is planning on it or is about relevant things, it could be interesting. otherswise, not so interested in smalltalk\nSimon Jackson: whats AI ?\nRegina: 1. The last time I got tested was October 8-9 (I sent you the results). \nI had some problems with my microflora, but almost no symptoms. This time, a few days after sex, I started feeling irritated, so I just bought the antibiotics they recommended for microflora and I started taking them today. \n\nI'm not sure, maybe I should get tested again. \n\nI only had sex with you. Maybe you also should check yourself to make sure everything is okay, because some things can exist without any symptoms. I want to make sure everything is okay for both of us. \n\nI also need to get a blood test, in October I was told to wait until the end of November\nRegina: Annoying Irritation lol. I am just trying to stay positive even when I am sick\nRegina: 5. I understand it. I like to discuss ideas, not sure if I am interested in participating, but I can understand what works and what doesn't\nRegina: 1. Let me know what you think. I think maybe I should take a test tomorrow and therefore not take another pill today. I don't think my condition changed from one pill, I only feel a little dizzy\nSimon Jackson: if you feel sick, you should see if there‚Äôs something wrong\nRegina: Yeah, you're right. Will do tomorrow\nRegina: Are you by chance in the office tonight? I just have no will to carry all my stuff and go back to the lab in the morning\nSimon Jackson: always\nRegina: Can I come later with my laptop? won't bother you with smalltalk\nSimon Jackson: if you want\n(üôè 1)\nRegina: 15 minutes\nRegina: Arrived\nSimon Jackson: you heer\nSimon Jackson: ok one sec\nRegina: Have already received the test results. \n\nOverall, it felt like vaginal thrush, which I have had twice in my life before, not even having sex with anyone. \nAlthough this time my symptoms include only annoying irritation. \nTaking one 150 mg dose of fluconazole helped me, so I am going to do the same.  \n\nNot sure if you should get any tests done if you are not experiencing any symptoms\nRegina: üìÑ [Ms. REGINA FILKO 2411270011817OR_Detected (1).pdf]\nSimon Jackson: Ok so all is good or\nRegina: üñº [Picture]\nSimon Jackson: I‚Äôm not reading\nSimon Jackson: good or no?\nRegina: It's gonna be fine for me soon. and it's not dangerous for you too\nSimon Jackson: cool\nSimon Jackson: good day\nRegina: I need to protect sensitive pussy ü§£\nRegina: I forgot a sandwich for breakfast from Subway in the fridge of the office.\nThe fridge from the right side. Sandwich is in a paper bag. Maybe it's still ok\n\nIt was meant to be my breakfast. Eat it maybe\nSimon Jackson: no\nRegina: ok. wasted\nSimon Jackson: I am upset at these messages. i do not like them. i don‚Äôt care. Please\nSimon Jackson: don‚Äôt responde to this\nSimon Jackson: if you are coming and need let in or something lmk. otherwise i just want ot work\nSimon Jackson: thanks\nRegina: sorry, wasn't meant to upset you. I got it\nRegina: I understand that you are prioritizing your projects and may not have the capacity, time and interest to talk about the little things, that's okay, I noted. Not talking about food\n\nI hope you don't say \"I don't care\" about my feelings as if they are insignificant. \n\nI am upset about some things too, but I am coping. \nI hope we are doing well, as I value this communication and look at any difficulties in terms of improving the understanding",

        "I‚Äôm back - been a week or so since this. I had another date or if you wanna call it a date I had to hang out with a girl we met at night and we basically spent a few hours together like dancing and we got some food and we made out and walked around and it was really a beautiful time And we were out till like 6 AM and it was so cool. I really really enjoyed it. Now the reason I‚Äôm in this chat right now is because that she is not responding. You know it‚Äôs been like you know she went to sleep. Allegedly at like like at 6 AM it‚Äôs 7 PM now I sent a few messages. I sent a good morning message And then I sent like a you know potential itinerary for like hanging out in the daytime and no response so I was considering sending this message and but I think it‚Äôs a little bit desperate but I wanna send something to kinda like close out this and I think you know I mean the other part is I mean it might be like a little bit Forward or like jumping the shark you know but like she‚Äôs definitely awake right now right you know who sleeps for that long no one does like if she‚Äôs dead I don‚Äôt know like you know so I‚Äôm a little bit. It‚Äôs fine. I guess overall you know I think I‚Äôm blocking some Felix to be honest. I am sad. I‚Äôm sad about It. You know it really sucks. Really sucks to like I don‚Äôt know, man I‚Äôve been I‚Äôve been trying for the last like I don‚Äôt know I had like two dates in the past like couple weeks and it‚Äôs just like it just feels like I just feels like I‚Äôm not accepted for being myself. You know it just feels like I can‚Äôt. I have to Try harder to be like a more aggressive person like I just have to do a lot more shit and I don‚Äôt wanna do it. I don‚Äôt wanna be a more aggressive person. I just wanna do what I wanna do but at the end of the day it seems like whatever I wanna do is not the fucking thing that works like what actually works is being fucking aggressive. What actually works is fucking like when the girl says at the end of the night that she doesn‚Äôt wanna have sex? It‚Äôs like OK then you make up an excuse and you find a way to get into a room, regardless of whatever she says with her mouth, but I don‚Äôt want to be that type of dude I don‚Äôt wanna be that type of guy, but I have to be like Anytime I‚Äôve ever gotten any sort of result in my life is because I was somebody who is pushing way more in that direction and I don‚Äôt wanna do that I would rather treat girls with respect. I would rather you know if I call it like that if I would rather like take them out to eat I would rather like you know go out on walks with them. I would rather look them in the eyes and make out with them for three days in a row and then you know sleep with them after five months like two months like I would rather do all that stuff but then at the end of the fucking day I understand that what actually gets results is a person that‚Äôs confident and forward with everything and not even confident and forward, but you understand that you have to play the fucking game that you have to play so you have to do the things you have to do you have to make up an excuse you have to you have to give her reasons to allow yourself to sleep with you you have to do way more than you can‚Äôt just sit here and be a nice person if I wanna call it like that, it‚Äôs I freeze it that way because that‚Äôs my social conditioning speaking like a nice boy I wanna be a respectful guy at the end of the day in my teachings in my understanding of the world which is you know I constantly go back I revert back to this other version because that‚Äôs just what I would prefer. I would prefer the world to be this a place where I can just where I can just express myself the way I want and I can treat girls the way I want, which is nice. I wanna be a Disney boy. I wanna be lovely but at the end of the fucking day it seems like And then this is just true. It feels like it‚Äôs just true and I‚Äôm interested in your perspective. it‚Äôs just like I can‚Äôt do it like that. It‚Äôs just not reasonable. It‚Äôs not scientific. It‚Äôs not smart you are. I am like I am. I am insane. I‚Äôm just doing the same things over and over again, knowing that they don‚Äôt work knowing the result on the other end, knowing what happens if I tiptoe, knowing what happens if I‚Äôm not forward knowing what happens if I don‚Äôt set up a context where I can go back to her place or she can come back to my place knowing that if I don‚Äôt set these things up in advance, nothing is going to fucking happen. It‚Äôs just going to disappear and I know and I know what you might say. I know you might say it like not all girls are like that maybe there‚Äôs some girls that are like this like that. It depends on where you‚Äôre meeting them and you met this girl at nighttime so of course you met her at the club so of course she‚Äôs gonna be this type of girl but and I understand that you‚Äôre gonna say that, but I also I dis Aza√±a Sjafri I fucking disagree. I feel like it‚Äôs all I think it‚Äôs all in a while. You can while there‚Äôs some girls who who who need that extra space that need the extra time I think my feeling it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs this world and this is the difficulty. This is the thing with the social situation and this is you know I‚Äôve rejected it because you know I‚Äôve said that I am you know and this is the honest thing I say that I‚Äôm not interested in relationships with women I say that I‚Äôm not interested in going out and talking to these girls, but I think the honest thing is that I don‚Äôt like sucking at this thing I suck fucking I suck ass at doing this right now and I was better before and it sucks that I used to be ‚Äú‚Äú good and now I‚Äôm ‚Äú‚Äú bad and I can‚Äôt get the result that I would like and it‚Äôs extremely frustrating and as a result, I think my brain is concocted this thing the safety thing of I just don‚Äôt want to interact with women where we‚Äôre at the end of the fucking day I do and enjoy interacting. I do enjoy kissing. I do enjoy looking into their eyes. I do enjoy sleeping with them. I do enjoy the process. I do enjoy the game. It‚Äôs a fact I enjoy these things and yet I‚Äôm rejecting them and I think I‚Äôm rejecting it because I suck at it and I‚Äôm seeing that now after these two dates it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm I‚Äôm excusing all this shit when the other day the Reason I‚Äôm avoiding is because I suck that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs just the same reason I‚Äôm avoiding dancing or tango or Bachata is cause I suck and if I go to those places and I try to dance, I suck and it makes me feel bad so I just wanna avoid those bad, fucking Felix you know and so I don‚Äôt know. I guess this is bigger than the text. You know you know this is first of all you know, how do I respond you know I do want some fucking closure but I know the fucking answer but I still wanna send this goddamn message and I want a better way to send this fucking message so take a look at the message and then let‚Äôs talk about the rest of this thing cause I mean, I‚Äôm that you probably can‚Äôt hear my tone because obviously it‚Äôs being typed out by text to speech you know or speech to text so you can‚Äôt understand my tone, but maybe you can understand my tone is from the words that I‚Äôm saying ‚Äò cause I‚Äôm extremely frustrated extremely annoyed and I know the right way I know the right way and you know the thing The irony and the frustration of the idea of knowing the correct thing to do. This is the thing and this is the thing that‚Äôs happened a few times and it‚Äôs happening a few places in life where I will say that I know what is going on and it‚Äôs like with content, for example with making YouTube videos and Instagram videos, I can talk game I can talk the whole thing what to do what not to do how to make the videos I could do all this stuff and yet you know my friends comes to me and they‚Äôre like do they have music they wanna promote I can tell them all the stuff to do and yet for me, I now have really good songs that I can promote. I now have really good videos and really good clothing that I can promote even some software I can promote and yet I‚Äôm not doing those things. I know what to do to create clothing and yet I‚Äôm not creating the clothing that I need to create. I‚Äôm not communicating with the suppliers in the way that I need to communicate why I don‚Äôt understand end with women. OK I know what I need to say. I just described to you in my opinion the optimal way to interact with a woman all the way up until the end, you set up the fucking context that you need to do and then you give her an excuse to participate in the activities that you can that you can do and if she doesn‚Äôt want to participate, then that‚Äôs fine but you have to set up all the context to give her the actual decision and or the plausible deniability to engage or not engage and I did not set any of that up in this girl probably wanted to have sex. She probably wanted to engage with me that night. It might‚Äôve been a one night stand or it might‚Äôve been something that would‚Äôve continued into the future, but I did not set up anything in advance. I didn‚Äôt set up anything and as a result, we just left at the end of the day with me wandering close to our apartment hoping That she‚Äôs you know gonna take the lead and let me in when it‚Äôs like what the fuck we didn‚Äôt set up anything and she‚Äôs probably not this type of you know she‚Äôs the type of liberal type of girl. She probably wants to fuck but I did not set up fucking shit to do any of that so it‚Äôs like I know all that stuff and I can I can tell somebody and I can even teach it and yet for whatever godforsaken reason I‚Äôm not doing the things that I know I need to do. I‚Äôm not studying the way that I‚Äôm just study. I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm not engaging in projects the way that I need to engage in projects why for the love of God I can‚Äôt understand why I keep doing things the exact same way even though I have the understanding of what to do Lord, please help me with this. I just I need help with this. I I feel weird like you know talking to the AI like fucking help me like please please please please please help me. I don‚Äôt know what to do. it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs a low moment right now. It‚Äôs like I need help. I need help. I cannot do this by myself. I can‚Äôt I can‚Äôt About to cry a little bit like I just can‚Äôt do it by myself. I‚Äôve tried. I‚Äôve tried so many times and I have meditate. I‚Äôve just done so many things and I just can‚Äôt do this. I can‚Äôt do this like I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm I just don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt know why I act the way that I act even though I know all this stuff, why why can‚Äôt I stick to a schedule? Why can‚Äôt I I do make the content why can I make the music? Why can‚Äôt I talk to the girls? Why can‚Äôt I have the relationships that I wanna have? I can see things deteriorating around me because I‚Äôm not engaging with the world and the way that I know that I should be able to engage with the world Why why am I watching my universe my world dissolve in front of me and I‚Äôm powerless to stop it I‚Äôm just watching everything crumble and die and it‚Äôs for fucking what I‚Äôm switching from project to project with. No fucking intent no fucking no no purpose no no thing just finish fucking one thing you know just I have nothing and I‚Äôm just watching everything die and it‚Äôs almost like OK you know let me let me like the feeling. It‚Äôs like OK let me Let everything die and then I can fucking start it over again. That‚Äôs like the feeling. It‚Äôs just like quit everything one more time and then start over and then maybe you can do it again from scratch again and that‚Äôs the way you know the honest part I‚Äôve done that so many times with these projects these little AI projects that I‚Äôve been coding. This is like a microcosm of my life. I start to make this project and I think I know how to create this project and we get deep into the project and we get to a decent point and then we get to a point and something gets hard or something breaks so I don‚Äôt know what to do next and then we scrap the whole fucking project and we start over from scratch even though we‚Äôve already outlined the PRD even though we have the tech spec even though we have like fucking 50 to 60% of a prototype though even though we have all these things, I fucking scrap all of it and we start again from scratch, and the evidence is in the fucking dog shit pile of project files in my GitHub folder holy Shit the amount of things that I‚Äôve done. I just man this is bigger than girls is bigger than everything it‚Äôs bigger than fucking all of it. It‚Äôs just a lifestyle. It‚Äôs a whole thing it‚Äôs it‚Äôs a whole thing and I just need help and the funny part is it started with this text so I‚Äôm gonna give you the text that I want to send, and then we can talk about the rest.\n\n\nThe text:\nI really had a nice time and I think you did too, so I‚Äôm confused. I‚Äôll leave you alone, I guess just interested in why you‚Äôre not interested or why you are ghosting me? All good in general hope you have a good vacation and nice life if I don‚Äôt hear back I‚Äôm back - been a week or so since this.

I start to make this project and I think I know how to create this project and we get deep into the project and we get to a decent point and then we get to a point and something gets hard or something breaks so I don‚Äôt know what to do next and then we scrap the whole fucking project and we start over from scratch even though we‚Äôve already outlined the PRD even though we have the tech spec even though we have like fucking 50 to 60% of a prototype though even though we have all these things, I fucking scrap all of it and we start again from scratch, and the evidence is in the fucking dog shit pile of project files in my GitHub folder holy Shit the amount of things that I‚Äôve done. I just man this is bigger than girls is bigger than everything it‚Äôs bigger than fucking all of it. It‚Äôs just a lifestyle. It‚Äôs a whole thing it‚Äôs it‚Äôs a whole thing and I just need help and the funny part is it started with this text so I‚Äôm gonna give you the text that I want to send, and then we can talk about the rest.\n\n\nThe text:\nI really had a nice time and I think you did too, so I‚Äôm confused. I‚Äôll leave you alone, I guess just interested in why you‚Äôre not interested or why you are ghosting me? All good in general hope you have a good vacation and nice life if I don‚Äôt hear back"

        "I‚Äôm back - been a week or so since this. I had another date or if you wanna call it a date I had to hang out with a girl we met at night and we basically spent a few hours together like dancing and we got some food and we made out and walked around and it was really a beautiful time And we were out till like 6 AM and it was so cool. I really really enjoyed it. Now the reason I‚Äôm in this chat right now is because that she is not responding. You know it‚Äôs been like you know she went to sleep. Allegedly at like like at 6 AM it‚Äôs 7 PM now I sent a few messages. I sent a good morning message And then I sent like a you know potential itinerary for like hanging out in the daytime and no response so I was considering sending this message and but I think it‚Äôs a little bit desperate but I wanna send something to kinda like close out this and I think you know I mean the other part is I mean it might be like a little bit Forward or like jumping the shark you know but like she‚Äôs definitely awake right now right you know who sleeps for that long no one does like if she‚Äôs dead I don‚Äôt know like you know so I‚Äôm a little bit. It‚Äôs fine. I guess overall you know I think I‚Äôm blocking some Felix to be honest. I am sad. I‚Äôm sad about It. You know it really sucks. Really sucks to like I don‚Äôt know, man I‚Äôve been I‚Äôve been trying for the last like I don‚Äôt know I had like two dates in the past like couple weeks and it‚Äôs just like it just feels like I just feels like I‚Äôm not accepted for being myself. You know it just feels like I can‚Äôt. I have to Try harder to be like a more aggressive person like I just have to do a lot more shit and I don‚Äôt wanna do it. I don‚Äôt wanna be a more aggressive person. I just wanna do what I wanna do but at the end of the day it seems like whatever I wanna do is not the fucking thing that works like what actually works is being fucking aggressive. What actually works is fucking like when the girl says at the end of the night that she doesn‚Äôt wanna have sex? It‚Äôs like OK then you make up an excuse and you find a way to get into a room, regardless of whatever she says with her mouth, but I don‚Äôt want to be that type of dude I don‚Äôt wanna be that type of guy, but I have to be like Anytime I‚Äôve ever gotten any sort of result in my life is because I was somebody who is pushing way more in that direction and I don‚Äôt wanna do that I would rather treat girls with respect. I would rather you know if I call it like that if I would rather like take them out to eat I would rather like you know go out on walks with them. I would rather look them in the eyes and make out with them for three days in a row and then you know sleep with them after five months like two months like I would rather do all that stuff but then at the end of the fucking day I understand that what actually gets results is a person that‚Äôs confident and forward with everything and not even confident and forward, but you understand that you have to play the fucking game that you have to play so you have to do the things you have to do you have to make up an excuse you have to you have to give her reasons to allow yourself to sleep with you you have to do way more than you can‚Äôt just sit here and be a nice person if I wanna call it like that, it‚Äôs I freeze it that way because that‚Äôs my social conditioning speaking like a nice boy I wanna be a respectful guy at the end of the day in my teachings in my understanding of the world which is you know I constantly go back I revert back to this other version because that‚Äôs just what I would prefer. I would prefer the world to be this a place where I can just where I can just express myself the way I want and I can treat girls the way I want, which is nice. I wanna be a Disney boy. I wanna be lovely but at the end of the fucking day it seems like And then this is just true. It feels like it‚Äôs just true and I‚Äôm interested in your perspective. it‚Äôs just like I can‚Äôt do it like that. It‚Äôs just not reasonable. It‚Äôs not scientific. It‚Äôs not smart you are. I am like I am. I am insane. I‚Äôm just doing the same things over and over again, knowing that they don‚Äôt work knowing the result on the other end, knowing what happens if I tiptoe, knowing what happens if I‚Äôm not forward knowing what happens if I don‚Äôt set up a context where I can go back to her place or she can come back to my place knowing that if I don‚Äôt set these things up in advance, nothing is going to fucking happen. It‚Äôs just going to disappear and I know and I know what you might say. I know you might say it like not all girls are like that maybe there‚Äôs some girls that are like this like that. It depends on where you‚Äôre meeting them and you met this girl at nighttime so of course you met her at the club so of course she‚Äôs gonna be this type of girl but and I understand that you‚Äôre gonna say that, but I also I dis Aza√±a Sjafri I fucking disagree. I feel like it‚Äôs all I think it‚Äôs all in a while. You can while there‚Äôs some girls who who who need that extra space that need the extra time I think my feeling it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs this world and this is the difficulty. This is the thing with the social situation and this is you know I‚Äôve rejected it because you know I‚Äôve said that I am you know and this is the honest thing I say that I‚Äôm not interested in relationships with women I say that I‚Äôm not interested in going out and talking to these girls, but I think the honest thing is that I don‚Äôt like sucking at this thing I suck fucking I suck ass at doing this right now and I was better before and it sucks that I used to be ‚Äú‚Äú good and now I‚Äôm ‚Äú‚Äú bad and I can‚Äôt get the result that I would like and it‚Äôs extremely frustrating and as a result, I think my brain is concocted this thing the safety thing of I just don‚Äôt want to interact with women where we‚Äôre at the end of the fucking day I do and enjoy interacting. I do enjoy kissing. I do enjoy looking into their eyes. I do enjoy sleeping with them. I do enjoy the process. I do enjoy the game. It‚Äôs a fact I enjoy these things and yet I‚Äôm rejecting them and I think I‚Äôm rejecting it because I suck at it and I‚Äôm seeing that now after these two dates it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm I‚Äôm excusing all this shit when the other day the Reason I‚Äôm avoiding is because I suck that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs just the same reason I‚Äôm avoiding dancing or tango or Bachata is cause I suck and if I go to those places and I try to dance, I suck and it makes me feel bad so I just wanna avoid those bad, fucking Felix you know and so I don‚Äôt know. I guess this is bigger than the text. You know you know this is first of all you know, how do I respond you know I do want some fucking closure but I know the fucking answer but I still wanna send this goddamn message and I want a better way to send this fucking message so take a look at the message and then let‚Äôs talk about the rest of this thing cause I mean, I‚Äôm that you probably can‚Äôt hear my tone because obviously it‚Äôs being typed out by text to speech you know or speech to text so you can‚Äôt understand my tone, but maybe you can understand my tone is from the words that I‚Äôm saying ‚Äò cause I‚Äôm extremely frustrated extremely annoyed and I know the right way I know the right way and you know the thing The irony and the frustration of the idea of knowing the correct thing to do. This is the thing and this is the thing that‚Äôs happened a few times and it‚Äôs happening a few places in life where I will say that I know what is going on and it‚Äôs like with content, for example with making YouTube videos and Instagram videos, I can talk game I can talk the whole thing what to do what not to do how to make the videos I could do all this stuff and yet you know my friends comes to me and they‚Äôre like do they have music they wanna promote I can tell them all the stuff to do and yet for me, I now have really good songs that I can promote. I now have really good videos and really good clothing that I can promote even some software I can promote and yet I‚Äôm not doing those things. I know what to do to create clothing and yet I‚Äôm not creating the clothing that I need to create. I‚Äôm not communicating with the suppliers in the way that I need to communicate why I don‚Äôt understand end with women. OK I know what I need to say. I just described to you in my opinion the optimal way to interact with a woman all the way up until the end, you set up the fucking context that you need to do and then you give her an excuse to participate in the activities that you can that you can do and if she doesn‚Äôt want to participate, then that‚Äôs fine but you have to set up all the context to give her the actual decision and or the plausible deniability to engage or not engage and I did not set any of that up in this girl probably wanted to have sex. She probably wanted to engage with me that night. It might‚Äôve been a one night stand or it might‚Äôve been something that would‚Äôve continued into the future, but I did not set up anything in advance. I didn‚Äôt set up anything and as a result, we just left at the end of the day with me wandering close to our apartment hoping That she‚Äôs you know gonna take the lead and let me in when it‚Äôs like what the fuck we didn‚Äôt set up anything and she‚Äôs probably not this type of you know she‚Äôs the type of liberal type of girl. She probably wants to fuck but I did not set up fucking shit to do any of that so it‚Äôs like I know all that stuff and I can I can tell somebody and I can even teach it and yet for whatever godforsaken reason I‚Äôm not doing the things that I know I need to do. I‚Äôm not studying the way that I‚Äôm just study. I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm not engaging in projects the way that I need to engage in projects why for the love of God I can‚Äôt understand why I keep doing things the exact same way even though I have the understanding of what to do Lord, please help me with this. I just I need help with this. I I feel weird like you know talking to the AI like fucking help me like please please please please please help me. I don‚Äôt know what to do. it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs a low moment right now. It‚Äôs like I need help. I need help. I cannot do this by myself. I can‚Äôt I can‚Äôt About to cry a little bit like I just can‚Äôt do it by myself. I‚Äôve tried. I‚Äôve tried so many times and I have meditate. I‚Äôve just done so many things and I just can‚Äôt do this. I can‚Äôt do this like I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm I just don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt know why I act the way that I act even though I know all this stuff, why why can‚Äôt I stick to a schedule? Why can‚Äôt I I do make the content why can I make the music? Why can‚Äôt I talk to the girls? Why can‚Äôt I have the relationships that I wanna have? I can see things deteriorating around me because I‚Äôm not engaging with the world and the way that I know that I should be able to engage with the world Why why am I watching my universe my world dissolve in front of me and I‚Äôm powerless to stop it I‚Äôm just watching everything crumble and die and it‚Äôs for fucking what I‚Äôm switching from project to project with. No fucking intent no fucking no no purpose no no thing just finish fucking one thing you know just I have nothing and I‚Äôm just watching everything die and it‚Äôs almost like OK you know let me let me like the feeling. It‚Äôs like OK let me Let everything die and then I can fucking start it over again. That‚Äôs like the feeling. It‚Äôs just like quit everything one more time and then start over and then maybe you can do it again from scratch again and that‚Äôs the way you know the honest part I‚Äôve done that so many times with these projects these little AI projects that I‚Äôve been coding. This is like a microcosm of my life. I start to make this project and I think I know how to create this project and we get deep into the project and we get to a decent point and then we get to a point and something gets hard or something breaks so I don‚Äôt know what to do next and then we scrap the whole fucking project and we start over from scratch even though we‚Äôve already outlined the PRD even though we have the tech spec even though we have like fucking 50 to 60% of a prototype though even though we have all these things, I fucking scrap all of it and we start again from scratch, and the evidence is in the fucking dog shit pile of project files in my GitHub folder holy Shit the amount of things that I‚Äôve done. I just man this is bigger than girls is bigger than everything it‚Äôs bigger than fucking all of it. It‚Äôs just a lifestyle. It‚Äôs a whole thing it‚Äôs it‚Äôs a whole thing and I just need help and the funny part is it started with this text so I‚Äôm gonna give you the text that I want to send, and then we can talk about the rest.\n\n\nThe text:\nI really had a nice time and I think you did too, so I‚Äôm confused. I‚Äôll leave you alone, I guess just interested in why you‚Äôre not interested or why you are ghosting me? All good in general hope you have a good vacation and nice life if I don‚Äôt hear back I‚Äôm back - been a week or so since this. I had another date or if you wanna call it a date I had to hang out with a girl we met at night and we basically spent a few hours together like dancing and we got some food and we made out and walked around and it was really a beautiful time And we were out till like 6 AM and it was so cool. I really really enjoyed it. Now the reason I‚Äôm in this chat right now is because that she is not responding. You know it‚Äôs been like you know she went to sleep. Allegedly at like like at 6 AM it‚Äôs 7 PM now I sent a few messages. I sent a good morning message And then I sent like a you know potential itinerary for like hanging out in the daytime and no response so I was considering sending this message and but I think it‚Äôs a little bit desperate but I wanna send something to kinda like close out this and I think you know I mean the other part is I mean it might be like a little bit Forward or like jumping the shark you know but like she‚Äôs definitely awake right now right you know who sleeps for that long no one does like if she‚Äôs dead I don‚Äôt know like you know so I‚Äôm a little bit. It‚Äôs fine. I guess overall you know I think I‚Äôm blocking some Felix to be honest. I am sad. I‚Äôm sad about It. You know it really sucks. Really sucks to like I don‚Äôt know, man I‚Äôve been I‚Äôve been trying for the last like I don‚Äôt know I had like two dates in the past like couple weeks and it‚Äôs just like it just feels like I just feels like I‚Äôm not accepted for being myself. You know it just feels like I can‚Äôt. I have to Try harder to be like a more aggressive person like I just have to do a lot more shit and I don‚Äôt wanna do it. I don‚Äôt wanna be a more aggressive person. I just wanna do what I wanna do but at the end of the day it seems like whatever I wanna do is not the fucking thing that works like what actually works is being fucking aggressive. What actually works is fucking like when the girl says at the end of the night that she doesn‚Äôt wanna have sex? It‚Äôs like OK then you make up an excuse and you find a way to get into a room, regardless of whatever she says with her mouth, but I don‚Äôt want to be that type of dude I don‚Äôt wanna be that type of guy, but I have to be like Anytime I‚Äôve ever gotten any sort of result in my life is because I was somebody who is pushing way more in that direction and I don‚Äôt wanna do that I would rather treat girls with respect.

        "Honestly, I do wanna double the emotional side a little bit because and then go through practical stuff because it is and I don't know what that means. I don't know what that helps or what it will do, but yeah man it's you hit the nail on the fucking head with all this like it's exact it's exact you got exact thing like it's it's everything it's like yeah who I need to be. It's like well I want to be yeah I wanna be a certain thing in and I and I feel like I can't you know it's with email you you just did it exactly with them. You know it goes across all the things you know with dating I wanna just be a nice boy whatever the fuck that means I just wanna be a nice I just wanna go up to people and say something and be kind of funny and be a nerd and I don't wanna I don't wanna like I don't wanna think of what to do in advance. I don't want to craft the play and I don't want to do any of the stuff and in and the girls don't like me enough. It feels like the girls don't girls don't like me enough for me to just and by the way they have in my life but just now it's just like that yeah they don't like me and they like me by the way girls do like me that's the fucking weird part and all of this things and you understand I'm just gonna I'm probably gonna be repeating myself a little bit but girls do like me you know and I am good at making soft if I'm good at making software I'm good at writing stuff. I'm good at creating things. I know my I know my my clothing is cool people like it. People of know I go to these conferences and people like hundreds of people come up and they want pictures and they want photos and they wanna engage with me and so I know I have external validation of all of the stuff. And even with the music, I've shown people some of the music that I've created. I've shown people and it's AI you know, but people have listened to the music that I've created and they like it. They like it and they see the potential they like it and they're waiting for me to put out more stuff every little video that I put out every little thing I get tons of feedback with people like holy shit you're awesome can do more and yet I stopped. I don't know. I stopped because of that that the feel of that you know I feel like we need more of a strategy. I think I need more of a top level strategy all the way down I need to come up with a rollout plan for everything I need better. You know you got it right with the perfectionism it's like why do you know man that's it's perfect like you described it perfectly. It's like I'm experiencing a pattern of self sabotage where I just avoid doing things because I'm afraid of doing them poorly. It's just fucking a perfect way to say it and I don't know where that came from because I didn't have it the whole time I didn't have it. It's just something that manifested over the last four years or so. It's like it started to come. You know when I started making content in in 2021. I was just making stuff and putting stuff out and when I would talk to girls, I would just go out and I would you know suck or be good and I would get some girls or not and it was just freedom. I was just free you know and I had some depression and I had issues, but I was able to just make stuff and put it out and something happened when you know when I start when I went viral it's like you know and you don't have that full context but it's like I went viral on TikTok, I got like I got 17 million views on one video and then several videos with 1,000,000+ views and you know with these different dancing videos and you know the main context of the first video was me living in my office and I got so much validation from it. I fucking was killing the game. I had these live streams that were that were so big that you know again I mean it's all contextual but for me they were so big. It was so big that even TikTok reached out to me and they gave me a TikTok rep and I had like literally a direct line to talk to. You know to talk about things and to make stuff and they would be include me on these these lives you know these weekly round ups of live streams, and stuf and and I have there's a point where I was getting like 1 million you know 1 million views a week more than 1 million views even impressions a day there was a couple days I got 1,500,000 impression a day on my live stream. It was crazy and you know I think that you know the pattern started around then it's like you know we got to that. I don't know what happened in that at that time you know where it wa you know we had those crazy live stream, but it got to a point you know I wasn't making any money OK and that was one of the big things I wasn't making any money and that started to affect me because like I would do this crazy lifestream and I would have all this you know likes and all the stuff happen and and yeah, I wasn't able to pay for like I wasn't able to buy food. I wasn't able to buy the Uber home and I would have you know supporters that would send me money like even just to get home and do different things but it started to affect me like you know and you can't have these kids. You can't keep that up for forever. You know a lot of times you know they'll be up and down up and down with content, but I didn't have money and and the content started to you know on TikTok, especially men you can have any amount of followers. You can have any amount of thing but if you fall out of the algorithm now you're doing 1000 views for for a video 10,000 views for and man that fucking sucks it fucking sucks and then it fucking sucks even more when you're not making any money and you can't afford to even take a girl out you can't afford to even do the job. You know I had enough money to do the job and I feel like and if I would've kept going back then I would be at a different completely different point in life now, but I didn't you know and it's been up and down I don't know like even with the clothing stuff I don't know yeah I think you got it right I think you got it right it's yeah and you you got the thing it's like yeah I'm not bad at it. I'm not bad at anything. I'm good at things. I'm really good. I think I'm really good. I think there's evidence but I I I can't. I don't wanna put out garbage. I see what's good. I see what's good every day when when I scroll on Instagram and when I scroll on YouTube, I see what good is I see good clothes I see good content I see funny people and it's like I can't. You know I see good good music I even on Spotify I hear good music and it's like a YouTube. I hear good music like I can't you know putting out my shitty my thing and it's not shitty but like the idea like putting out my dumb video or my shitty strong like in the fucking thing it's like I don't know I'm gonna get I don't know. I feel like I'm gonna I'm gonna get 1000 views. I don't know what I don't really the actual thing because it's you're hitting something that's like not totally visible to me. It's not totally visible, but it's like I'm gonna post it and and it's gonna suck. No one's gonna care and and no one should care and it will suck it and I need to build it up and I understand those things. I understand that like you need to post for a while you need that you need to try you need to be trying to do things in new verticals and you need to be pushing and and I understand this and yet you know, I'm not I'm not doing those things and I know I'm hatching some of the stuff but I just I think you're it's really helping me. Try to understand like what the fuck is going on here cause I think I think you'I think you're understanding me a little bit more than I understand myself and I think we're starting to find that that spot I'm not gonna send that message. Thank you for that. Yeah, thank you for that but yeah that's a perfect thing. Yeah it's like yeah I don't wanna. I don't wanna behave a certain way with women like you know yeah instead of finding the middle ground, I just don't do it. You know it's just frustrating so I don't do yeah instead of you know and even with coding with coding like it's it's hard to suck you know coding it's hard to not know you know it's a slow process of learning react or learning you know vite** whatever and you know instead of like taking some time and maybe doing the tutorial once a day or twice a day in addition to all the stuff that I'm doing it's like I'd rather just use a an AI Dev thing you know I'd rather just have one of these LLMs code for me and put push the code instead of like learning some stuff myself like really actually actually learning some of the stuff myself you k you know they'll be some extent of just you know again you know I don't need to know a lot to do this, but like I should be, I want to get to a place where I'm a good developer like I wanna be at. I wanna be able to identify as a developer like why not you know how much effort like if I if I took a react course for like a month, I'd probably know all the stuff and I'd be able to really use these AI tools to their fullest extent and yet I'm just dabbling on the outskirts not willing to learn even one thing and I just it's like why and I'll take some fucking time and you know I can. I have kind of a diagnosed of ADHD, but I don't know if I I think that the problem isn't necessarily the ADHD. I think the problem is whatever you just pointed out. I think the part deacon contribute for sure but it's bigger thing. It's the bigger thing cause I I was able to focus on things before in college man you know I remember when I was a freshman and I was able to study for hours on this shit that I didn't care about you know and I was getting these good grades and I would do the same thing every day and I'll go to the library and you know the lifestyle I live right now it's so similar and yet I don't have the results. I don't have the ou that I could that I should in my opinion half I guess and I'm so afraid yeah I just yeah it's and I was talking to the girl yesterday. You know one of the girls that not this girl that we're talking about with that with this text but the other this, she was circling the circling this she was saying I was afraid of failure and I was like I don't know if I am, but it seems like I might be afraid of failure or afraid of maybe not afraid of failure, but I think that that you have it on the head that fear of like I don't I don't wanna do something shitty I want to put out a good thing. I wanna have a thing where people are like oh shit this is fucking amazing and then like you know and it's hard to like create one like even right now you know I have this some software for the for the for the company that I work for for the business that I that I started it's like we really need like three features like three specific things and when you be able to do them well and it's like three things we don't need a whole platform, but it's like I could create those and I have created those individual elements. Those are already. I have made those things already. You know I've made them and we don't need to make them anymore. It's done and we could put them in the production and get it for me. I wanna make the full application. I wanna make a full app that has everything in it. I wanna make it integrate with Telegram. I wanna make it integrated. I wanna have a Web App side next gues state of the art technology with all the bells and whistles. I want everything even though we only need really need need need to make money to make money and really push. We need two or three things you know it's just so you know it's so I wanna just get like maybe if we can just get some of the emotional I don't know just like really just crack open just really just I wanna see what the full thing I wanna have a full picture of myself right now. I just wanna see myself from the birds iview I wanna see it for I wanna see it. I want to be laid bear raw naked I wanna see everything here. I wanna see it all and then we can do the practical solutions, but I really wanna see everything. I wanna see all the different and I will see how everything connects. How does the dating I wanna see it all cause you hit the nail on the head but I just wanna see it all. I just wanna see it all. I just wanna itch. I wanna scratch the itch. I wanna see it all. It's just it hurts. It fucking hurts and it's makes me feel inferior. Doesn't make me feel good. It makes me feel and I feel like I feel like I should've. I feel like I should've solved this. I feel like I should be done. You know I turned 31 in one month one month from today I'll be 31 and that's so old. no it's not actually old right it's not actually old but it's so old you know and people have kids now people have whole businesses. People are executives peop like people are you know millions and millions of followers and people are all of these things and 10 years younger than me and five years younger than me you know and I'm losing my hair I'm balding I'm balding and I can't. You know some days. It feels like I can't take care of myself. It's you know I had something earlier this month. It's like I lost it like I lost $3000 like and I don't even know where it is. I don't know how I think I just left it on a table and just forgot about it. I don't know if this is and I'm sorry sorry about the non-sex order. It's just like a random thing, but it's like things happen all the time like this you know I can go back and think of these moments where it's like I just you know we have we're on the brink of something crazy and I just like just fuck things up like you I remember you know in 2019 you know I think it's 20 2019 I was a project manager at a decent company and I had a trajectory and yet you know I didn't have enough work and I decided to like not I didn't. I just decided to not learn anything new and just fuck off and you know design clothes at work like why I had I literally just make it like $4000 a month free and clear like doing almost nothing like why would I throw that away? I threw it away. I just threw it away. I just didn't. I just took everything for granted, I threw it and why you know and then you know and then I had some money and then I was making clothes I was drop shipping in the summer and I got some credit cards and I was pushing and I got a loan from Shopify from Shopify and it's like you know I used it but like I didn't fully understand the stuff and I spent all this money and now I've always debt and I can't use credit cards anymore. I destroyed it I destroyed all of my credit and everything and just a year then I went to Russia and I was like OK I'm just gonna move to Russia who cares and even go to Russia dude when I was, I was going to go teach English in Russia and I I like you know literally on the flight like I had a flight. I had that I had everything lined up and I was on the flight and you know I had a layover in Boston and I fucking lost my pass. I put my coat down and I lost my passport like my the one thing I need to just put my coat on the thing and I just forgot it and I just lost it and I couldn't get it back and the police couldn't find it cause there's no cameras in the airport and there's no cameras I guess in the back area of the airport and it's just fine. I don't have a code and I don't have a passport and I had to go back home. I had to ask my friend for money and even after that I have one thing which is I had to save up money. I had to get a new passport three months like a month goes by. I have everything lined up again flight paid for and I and I arrived to the airport late and I miss my international flight. I overslept or I forget the exact thing but I missed it like I miss my international flight. I think I missed it twice and I had to ask one of my friends for help and he helped me and I paid him back but it's like what the fuck and I can't even tell you how many times I've just missed flights. I can't even tell you how many times I miss flights so many times you know and I feel like I just constantly like you know I constantly have these things were just like I don't know like just I don't know. It's like on purpose if it just feels like it's on purpose and it feels like I can't trust myself. It feels like I can't like I feel like I can't trust my brain with basic things and even so even if everything is going well it's like something can just happen. it feels like something can just happen that just you know I was doing well for a while even even without you know OK I'm avoiding all this stuff and I'm you know fear of imperfection but even over the last couple months I was doing OK I was doing fine and then I lost this significant amount of money and now we're like behind on everything you know and it's like for like wow how is it possible? It's like the dumbest thing in the world. I just can't trust my own fucking brain or body with basic things you know it's this and it feels like it's all connected like this like truly internal deep thing inside where it's like if anything starts to go OK then we're just something they're just we're just gonna fucking spike. We're gonna fucking spike the ball in the Enzo and fucking takeoff our clothes and streak around and ruin everything and just and start all over again. you know I don't know what that is. Don't know where it's coming from but that just feels like my life. It feels like every six months every three months we just have a life altering thing just . I just feel like people other people don't have this thing. Why am I do it? Why am I losing this amount of money? Why am I missing these flights? Why am I losing my passports? Why am I like? Why am I having to relearn speaking to women like do you understand the amount of times that I've done this? I feel like I've done even this without AI without AI and without kind of help maybe but it's like I've done this kind of like reset thing like so many times it's not on comment. It's so many times I've learned how to speak to women again and again and again and again I've learned how to work I've learned how to be a basic human being and in a workplace again and again and again and I understand you need to speak to people. I understand you need to hang out with people in the off hours. You need to spend time you need to you need to call them. You need to talk to them even though them even if they don't put in every themselves you have to do that you have to do that to have good relationships in this life and I understand that and I've had to relearn it, redo it again and again I've had to relearn assertiveness. I've had to relearn what it means to be a man what it mea to express yourself to a girl what it means to be genuine and not some Disney genuine, like not some charming like actually express yourself to a person who you like I've learned it so many times even in a genuinely I've just learned it and I feel like why am I re-learning a dude it's like it's like how is it possible? I'm like that you know some broken AI model who's just you know forgets the context of life over and over it's like it's laughable. I'm even laughing a little bit now. How am I forgetting? The context that I'm in on a daily weekly monthly yearly basis and I look bac I have these reflections. I have these blog posts that I've created where it's like I have these things and that I've made that I just you know to know where I'm at in life and I look back and I'm like bro I did this already. This is d√©j√† vu. I've did this. I've done this. I've cried over a girl who's not texting back, who who I feel like I w not vulnerable enough with or two vulnerable or not I didn't do enough things. I've done this before I've done this tons of tens of times maybe not hundreds, but tens of times and hundreds if you wanna combine all these different situations kind of into one thing I've done this so many times I've done it so so so so so many times and it's like why how am I relearning over and over it's actually insan like can we and I understand by the way I understand like life is about learning life is about progression but I feel like man how have I not progressed dude I was sitting here in 19 thinking the same thoughts about girls at 19 and I solved it. I thought like a 20 x 26 I was sleeping with a lot of women and even I mean, I had a girlfriend when I was 27 I th like I thought I had some of this man you know and I know and I was able to even in my last official corporate job, dude my level of organization and the level that which I was able to ship project projects was insane. I was able to crush new projects over and over and over and here. I am like with these ideas that I'm still talking about after two months or three months of starting it how is it possible that I was able to just crushed through a new project in a fucking week or a couple days and here I am talking about the same bullshit like after three months it's not possible it's insane. How is it? Yeah so let's go through that. I just I want to see the full picture. I need to see the full picture. Bring it home for me like bring it home for me wrap it all up and show me who I am. I need to see it. I need to see it, I need to see it. Honestly, I do wanna double the emotional side a little bit because and then go through practical stuff because it is and I don't know what that means. I don't know what that helps or what it will do, but yeah man it's you hit the nail on the fucking head with all this like it's exact it's exact you got exact thing like it's it's everything it's like yeah who I need to be. It's like well I want to be yeah I wanna be a certain thing in and I and I feel like I can't you know it's with email you you just did it exactly with them. You know it goes across all the things you know with dating I wanna just be a nice boy whatever the fuck that means I just wanna be a nice I just wanna go up to people and say something and be kind of funny and be a nerd and I don't wanna I don't wanna like I don't wanna think of what to do in advance. I don't want to craft the play and I don't want to do any of the stuff and in and the girls don't like me enough. It feels like the girls don't girls don't like me enough for me to just and by the way they have in my life but just now it's just like that yeah they don't like me and they like me by the way girls do like me that's the fucking weird part and all of this things and you understand I'm just gonna I'm probably gonna be repeating myself a little bit but girls do like me you know and I am good at making soft if I'm good at making software I'm good at writing stuff. I'm good at creating things. I know my I know my my clothing is cool people like it. People of know I go to these conferences and people like hundreds of people come up and they want pictures and they want photos and they wanna engage with me and so I know I have external validation of all of the stuff. And even with the music, I've shown people some of the music that I've created. I've shown people and it's AI you know, but people have listened to the music that I've created and they like it. They like it and they see the potential they like it and they're waiting for me to put out more stuff every little video that I put out every little thing I get tons of feedback with people like holy shit you're awesome can do more and yet I stopped. I don't know. I stopped because of that that the feel of that you know I feel like we need more of a strategy. I think I need more of a top level strategy all the way down I need to come up with a rollout plan for everything I need better. You know you got it right with the perfectionism it's like why do you know man that's it's perfect like you described it perfectly. It's like I'm experiencing a pattern of self sabotage where I just avoid doing things because I'm afraid of doing them poorly. It's just fucking a perfect way to say it and I don't know where that came from because I didn't have it the whole time I didn't have it. It's just something that manifested over the last four years or so. It's like it started to come. You know when I started making content in in 2021. I was just making stuff and putting stuff out and when I would talk to girls, I would just go out and I would you know suck or be good and I would get some girls or not and it was just freedom. I was just free you know and I had some depression and I had issues, but I was able to just make stuff and put it out and something happened when you know when I start when I went viral it's like you know and you don't have that full context but it's like I went viral on TikTok, I got like I got 17 million views on one video and then several videos with 1,000,000+ views and you know with these different dancing videos and you know the main context of the first video was me living in my office and I got so much validation from it. I fucking was killing the game. I had these live streams that were that were so big that you know again I mean it's all contextual but for me they were so big. It was so big that even TikTok reached out to me and they gave me a TikTok rep and I had like literally a direct line to talk to. You know to talk about things and to make stuff and they would be include me on these these lives you know these weekly round ups of live streams, and stuf and and I have there's a point where I was getting like 1 million you know 1 million views a week more than 1 million views even impressions a day there was a couple days I got 1,500,000 impression a day on my live stream. It was crazy and you know I think that you know the pattern started around then it's like you know we got to that. I don't know what happened in that at that time you know where it wa you know we had those crazy live stream, but it got to a point you know I wasn't making any money OK and that was one of the big things I wasn't making any money and that started to affect me because like I would do this crazy lifestream and I would have all this you know likes and all the stuff happen and and yeah, I wasn't able to pay for like I wasn't able to buy food. I wasn't able to buy the Uber home and I would have you know supporters that would send me money like even just to get home and do different things but it started to affect me like you know and you can't have these kids. You can't keep that up for forever. You know a lot of times you know they'll be up and down up and down with content, but I didn't have money and and the content started to you know on TikTok, especially men you can have any amount of followers. You can have any amount of thing but if you fall out of the algorithm now you're doing 1000 views for for a video 10,000 views for and man that fucking sucks it fucking sucks and then it fucking sucks even more when you're not making any money and you can't afford to even take a girl out you can't afford to even do the job. You know I had enough money to do the job and I feel like and if I would've kept going back then I would be at a different completely different point in life now, but I didn't you know and it's been up and down I don't know like even with the clothing stuff I don't know yeah I think you got it right I think you got it right it's yeah and you you got the thing it's like yeah I'm not bad at it. I'm not bad at anything. I'm good at things. I'm really good. I think I'm really good. I think there's evidence but I I I can't. I don't wanna put out garbage. I see what's good. I see what's good every day when when I scroll on Instagram and when I scroll on YouTube, I see what good is I see good clothes I see good content I see funny people and it's like I can't. You know I see good good music I even on Spotify I hear good music and it's like a YouTube. I hear good music like I can't you know putting out my shitty my thing and it's not shitty but like the idea like putting out my dumb video or my shitty strong like in the fucking thing it's like I don't know I'm gonna get I don't know. I feel like I'm gonna I'm gonna get 1000 views. I don't know what I don't really the actual thing because it's you're hitting something that's like not totally visible to me. It's not totally visible, but it's like I'm gonna post it and and it's gonna suck. No one's gonna care and and no one should care and it will suck it and I need to build it up and I understand those things. I understand that like you need to post for a while you need that you need to try you need to be trying to do things in new verticals and you need to be pushing and and I understand this and yet you know, I'm not I'm not doing those things and I know I'm hatching some of the stuff but I just I think you're it's really helping me. Try to understand like what the fuck is going on here cause I think I think you'I think you're understanding me a little bit more than I understand myself and I think we're starting to find that that spot I'm not gonna send that message. Thank you for that. Yeah, thank you for that but yeah that's a perfect thing. Yeah it's like yeah I don't wanna. I don't wanna behave a certain way with women like you know yeah instead of finding the middle ground, I just don't do it.

It's so many times I've learned how to speak to women again and again and again and again I've learned how to work I've learned how to be a basic human being and in a workplace again and again and again and I understand you need to speak to people. I understand you need to hang out with people in the off hours. You need to spend time you need to you need to call them. You need to talk to them even though them even if they don't put in every themselves you have to do that you have to do that to have good relationships in this life and I understand that and I've had to relearn it, redo it again and again I've had to relearn assertiveness. I've had to relearn what it means to be a man what it mea to express yourself to a girl what it means to be genuine and not some Disney genuine, like not some charming like actually express yourself to a person who you like I've learned it so many times even in a genuinely I've just learned it and I feel like why am I re-learning a dude it's like it's like how is it possible? I'm like that you know some broken AI model who's just you know forgets the context of life over and over it's like it's laughable. I'm even laughing a little bit now. How am I forgetting? The context that I'm in on a daily weekly monthly yearly basis and I look bac I have these reflections. I have these blog posts that I've created where it's like I have these things and that I've made that I just you know to know where I'm at in life and I look back and I'm like bro I did this already. This is d√©j√† vu. I've did this. I've done this. I've cried over a girl who's not texting back, who who I feel like I w not vulnerable enough with or two vulnerable or not I didn't do enough things. I've done this before I've done this tons of tens of times maybe not hundreds, but tens of times and hundreds if you wanna combine all these different situations kind of into one thing I've done this so many times I've done it so so so so so many times and it's like why how am I relearning over and over it's actually insan like can we and I understand by the way I understand like life is about learning life is about progression but I feel like man how have I not progressed dude I was sitting here in 19 thinking the same thoughts about girls at 19 and I solved it. I thought like a 20 x 26 I was sleeping with a lot of women and even I mean, I had a girlfriend when I was 27 I th like I thought I had some of this man you know and I know and I was able to even in my last official corporate job, dude my level of organization and the level that which I was able to ship project projects was insane. I was able to crush new projects over and over and over and here. I am like with these ideas that I'm still talking about after two months or three months of starting it how is it possible that I was able to just crushed through a new project in a fucking week or a couple days and here I am talking about the same bullshit like after three months it's not possible it's insane. How is it? Yeah so let's go through that. I just I want to see the full picture. I need to see the full picture. Bring it home for me like bring it home for me wrap it all up and show me who I am. I need to see it. I need to see it, I need to see it."

        "Honestly, I do wanna double the emotional side a little bit because and then go through practical stuff because it is and I don't know what that means. I don't know what that helps or what it will do, but yeah man it's you hit the nail on the fucking head with all this like it's exact it's exact you got exact thing like it's it's everything it's like yeah who I need to be. It's like well I want to be yeah I wanna be a certain thing in and I and I feel like I can't you know it's with email you you just did it exactly with them. You know it goes across all the things you know with dating I wanna just be a nice boy whatever the fuck that means I just wanna be a nice I just wanna go up to people and say something and be kind of funny and be a nerd and I don't wanna I don't wanna like I don't wanna think of what to do in advance. I don't want to craft the play and I don't want to do any of the stuff and in and the girls don't like me enough. It feels like the girls don't girls don't like me enough for me to just and by the way they have in my life but just now it's just like that yeah they don't like me and they like me by the way girls do like me that's the fucking weird part and all of this things and you understand I'm just gonna I'm probably gonna be repeating myself a little bit but girls do like me you know and I am good at making soft if I'm good at making software I'm good at writing stuff. I'm good at creating things. I know my I know my my clothing is cool people like it. People of know I go to these conferences and people like hundreds of people come up and they want pictures and they want photos and they wanna engage with me and so I know I have external validation of all of the stuff. And even with the music, I've shown people some of the music that I've created. I've shown people and it's AI you know, but people have listened to the music that I've created and they like it. They like it and they see the potential they like it and they're waiting for me to put out more stuff every little video that I put out every little thing I get tons of feedback with people like holy shit you're awesome can do more and yet I stopped. I don't know. I stopped because of that that the feel of that you know I feel like we need more of a strategy. I think I need more of a top level strategy all the way down I need to come up with a rollout plan for everything I need better. You know you got it right with the perfectionism it's like why do you know man that's it's perfect like you described it perfectly. It's like I'm experiencing a pattern of self sabotage where I just avoid doing things because I'm afraid of doing them poorly. It's just fucking a perfect way to say it and I don't know where that came from because I didn't have it the whole time I didn't have it. It's just something that manifested over the last four years or so. It's like it started to come. You know when I started making content in in 2021. I was just making stuff and putting stuff out and when I would talk to girls, I would just go out and I would you know suck or be good and I would get some girls or not and it was just freedom. I was just free you know and I had some depression and I had issues, but I was able to just make stuff and put it out and something happened when you know when I start when I went viral it's like you know and you don't have that full context but it's like I went viral on TikTok, I got like I got 17 million views on one video and then several videos with 1,000,000+ views and you know with these different dancing videos and you know the main context of the first video was me living in my office and I got so much validation from it. I fucking was killing the game. I had these live streams that were that were so big that you know again I mean it's all contextual but for me they were so big. It was so big that even TikTok reached out to me and they gave me a TikTok rep and I had like literally a direct line to talk to. You know to talk about things and to make stuff and they would be include me on these these lives you know these weekly round ups of live streams, and stuf and and I have there's a point where I was getting like 1 million you know 1 million views a week more than 1 million views even impressions a day there was a couple days I got 1,500,000 impression a day on my live stream. It was crazy and you know I think that you know the pattern started around then it's like you know we got to that. I don't know what happened in that at that time you know where it wa you know we had those crazy live stream, but it got to a point you know I wasn't making any money OK and that was one of the big things I wasn't making any money and that started to affect me because like I would do this crazy lifestream and I would have all this you know likes and all the stuff happen and and yeah, I wasn't able to pay for like I wasn't able to buy food. I wasn't able to buy the Uber home and I would have you know supporters that would send me money like even just to get home and do different things but it started to affect me like you know and you can't have these kids. You can't keep that up for forever. You know a lot of times you know they'll be up and down up and down with content, but I didn't have money and and the content started to you know on TikTok, especially men you can have any amount of followers. You can have any amount of thing but if you fall out of the algorithm now you're doing 1000 views for for a video 10,000 views for and man that fucking sucks it fucking sucks and then it fucking sucks even more when you're not making any money and you can't afford to even take a girl out you can't afford to even do the job. You know I had enough money to do the job and I feel like and if I would've kept going back then I would be at a different completely different point in life now, but I didn't you know and it's been up and down I don't know like even with the clothing stuff I don't know yeah I think you got it right I think you got it right it's yeah and you you got the thing it's like yeah I'm not bad at it. I'm not bad at anything. I'm good at things. I'm really good. I think I'm really good. I think there's evidence but I I I can't. I don't wanna put out garbage. I see what's good. I see what's good every day when when I scroll on Instagram and when I scroll on YouTube, I see what good is I see good clothes I see good content I see funny people and it's like I can't. You know I see good good music I even on Spotify I hear good music and it's like a YouTube. I hear good music like I can't you know putting out my shitty my thing and it's not shitty but like the idea like putting out my dumb video or my shitty strong like in the fucking thing it's like I don't know I'm gonna get I don't know. I feel like I'm gonna I'm gonna get 1000 views. I don't know what I don't really the actual thing because it's you're hitting something that's like not totally visible to me. It's not totally visible, but it's like I'm gonna post it and and it's gonna suck. No one's gonna care and and no one should care and it will suck it and I need to build it up and I understand those things. I understand that like you need to post for a while you need that you need to try you need to be trying to do things in new verticals and you need to be pushing and and I understand this and yet you know, I'm not I'm not doing those things and I know I'm hatching some of the stuff but I just I think you're it's really helping me. Try to understand like what the fuck is going on here cause I think I think you'I think you're understanding me a little bit more than I understand myself and I think we're starting to find that that spot I'm not gonna send that message. Thank you for that. Yeah, thank you for that but yeah that's a perfect thing. Yeah it's like yeah I don't wanna. I don't wanna behave a certain way with women like you know yeah instead of finding the middle ground, I just don't do it. You know it's just frustrating so I don't do yeah instead of you know and even with coding with coding like it's it's hard to suck you know coding it's hard to not know you know it's a slow process of learning react or learning you know vite** whatever and you know instead of like taking some time and maybe doing the tutorial once a day or twice a day in addition to all the stuff that I'm doing it's like I'd rather just use a an AI Dev thing you know I'd rather just have one of these LLMs code for me and put push the code instead of like learning some stuff myself like really actually actually learning some of the stuff myself you k you know they'll be some extent of just you know again you know I don't need to know a lot to do this, but like I should be, I want to get to a place where I'm a good developer like I wanna be at. I wanna be able to identify as a developer like why not you know how much effort like if I if I took a react course for like a month, I'd probably know all the stuff and I'd be able to really use these AI tools to their fullest extent and yet I'm just dabbling on the outskirts not willing to learn even one thing and I just it's like why and I'll take some fucking time and you know I can. I have kind of a diagnosed of ADHD, but I don't know if I I think that the problem isn't necessarily the ADHD. I think the problem is whatever you just pointed out. I think the part deacon contribute for sure but it's bigger thing. It's the bigger thing cause I I was able to focus on things before in college man you know I remember when I was a freshman and I was able to study for hours on this shit that I didn't care about you know and I was getting these good grades and I would do the same thing every day and I'll go to the library and you know the lifestyle I live right now it's so similar and yet I don't have the results. I don't have the ou that I could that I should in my opinion half I guess and I'm so afraid yeah I just yeah it's and I was talking to the girl yesterday. You know one of the girls that not this girl that we're talking about with that with this text but the other this, she was circling the circling this she was saying I was afraid of failure and I was like I don't know if I am, but it seems like I might be afraid of failure or afraid of maybe not afraid of failure, but I think that that you have it on the head that fear of like I don't I don't wanna do something shitty I want to put out a good thing. I wanna have a thing where people are like oh shit this is fucking amazing and then like you know and it's hard to like create one like even right now you know I have this some software for the for the for the company that I work for for the business that I that I started it's like we really need like three features like three specific things and when you be able to do them well and it's like three things we don't need a whole platform, but it's like I could create those and I have created those individual elements. Those are already. I have made those things already. You know I've made them and we don't need to make them anymore. It's done and we could put them in the production and get it for me. I wanna make the full application. I wanna make a full app that has everything in it. I wanna make it integrate with Telegram. I wanna make it integrated. I wanna have a Web App side next gues state of the art technology with all the bells and whistles. I want everything even though we only need really need need need to make money to make money and really push. We need two or three things you know it's just so you know it's so I wanna just get like maybe if we can just get some of the emotional I don't know just like really just crack open just really just I wanna see what the full thing I wanna have a full picture of myself right now. I just wanna see myself from the birds iview I wanna see it for I wanna see it. I want to be laid bear raw naked I wanna see everything here. I wanna see it all and then we can do the practical solutions, but I really wanna see everything. I wanna see all the different and I will see how everything connects. How does the dating I wanna see it all cause you hit the nail on the head but I just wanna see it all. I just wanna see it all. I just wanna itch. I wanna scratch the itch. I wanna see it all. It's just it hurts. It fucking hurts and it's makes me feel inferior. Doesn't make me feel good. It makes me feel and I feel like I feel like I should've. I feel like I should've solved this. I feel like I should be done. You know I turned 31 in one month one month from today I'll be 31 and that's so old. no it's not actually old right it's not actually old but it's so old you know and people have kids now people have whole businesses. People are executives peop like people are you know millions and millions of followers and people are all of these things and 10 years younger than me and five years younger than me you know and I'm losing my hair I'm balding I'm balding and I can't. You know some days. It feels like I can't take care of myself. It's you know I had something earlier this month. It's like I lost it like I lost $3000 like and I don't even know where it is. I don't know how I think I just left it on a table and just forgot about it. I don't know if this is and I'm sorry sorry about the non-sex order. It's just like a random thing, but it's like things happen all the time like this you know I can go back and think of these moments where it's like I just you know we have we're on the brink of something crazy and I just like just fuck things up like you I remember you know in 2019 you know I think it's 20 2019 I was a project manager at a decent company and I had a trajectory and yet you know I didn't have enough work and I decided to like not I didn't. I just decided to not learn anything new and just fuck off and you know design clothes at work like why I had I literally just make it like $4000 a month free and clear like doing almost nothing like why would I throw that away? I threw it away. I just threw it away. I just didn't. I just took everything for granted, I threw it and why you know and then you know and then I had some money and then I was making clothes I was drop shipping in the summer and I got some credit cards and I was pushing and I got a loan from Shopify from Shopify and it's like you know I used it but like I didn't fully understand the stuff and I spent all this money and now I've always debt and I can't use credit cards anymore. I destroyed it I destroyed all of my credit and everything and just a year then I went to Russia and I was like OK I'm just gonna move to Russia who cares and even go to Russia dude when I was, I was going to go teach English in Russia and I I like you know literally on the flight like I had a flight. I had that I had everything lined up and I was on the flight and you know I had a layover in Boston and I fucking lost my pass. I put my coat down and I lost my passport like my the one thing I need to just put my coat on the thing and I just forgot it and I just lost it and I couldn't get it back and the police couldn't find it cause there's no cameras in the airport and there's no cameras I guess in the back area of the airport and it's just fine. I don't have a code and I don't have a passport and I had to go back home. I had to ask my friend for money and even after that I have one thing which is I had to save up money. I had to get a new passport three months like a month goes by. I have everything lined up again flight paid for and I and I arrived to the airport late and I miss my international flight. I overslept or I forget the exact thing but I missed it like I miss my international flight. I think I missed it twice and I had to ask one of my friends for help and he helped me and I paid him back but it's like what the fuck and I can't even tell you how many times I've just missed flights. I can't even tell you how many times I miss flights so many times you know and I feel like I just constantly like you know I constantly have these things were just like I don't know like just I don't know. It's like on purpose if it just feels like it's on purpose and it feels like I can't trust myself. It feels like I can't like I feel like I can't trust my brain with basic things and even so even if everything is going well it's like something can just happen. it feels like something can just happen that just you know I was doing well for a while even even without you know OK I'm avoiding all this stuff and I'm you know fear of imperfection but even over the last couple months I was doing OK I was doing fine and then I lost this significant amount of money and now we're like behind on everything you know and it's like for like wow how is it possible? It's like the dumbest thing in the world. I just can't trust my own fucking brain or body with basic things you know it's this and it feels like it's all connected like this like truly internal deep thing inside where it's like if anything starts to go OK then we're just something they're just we're just gonna fucking spike. We're gonna fucking spike the ball in the Enzo and fucking takeoff our clothes and streak around and ruin everything and just and start all over again. you know I don't know what that is. Don't know where it's coming from but that just feels like my life. It feels like every six months every three months we just have a life altering thing just . I just feel like people other people don't have this thing. Why am I do it? Why am I losing this amount of money? Why am I missing these flights? Why am I losing my passports? Why am I like? Why am I having to relearn speaking to women like do you understand the amount of times that I've done this? I feel like I've done even this without AI without AI and without kind of help maybe but it's like I've done this kind of like reset thing like so many times it's not on comment. It's so many times I've learned how to speak to women again and again and again and again I've learned how to work I've learned how to be a basic human being and in a workplace again and again and again and I understand you need to speak to people. I understand you need to hang out with people in the off hours. You need to spend time you need to you need to call them. You need to talk to them even though them even if they don't put in every themselves you have to do that you have to do that to have good relationships in this life and I understand that and I've had to relearn it, redo it again and again I've had to relearn assertiveness. I've had to relearn what it means to be a man what it mea to express yourself to a girl what it means to be genuine and not some Disney genuine, like not some charming like actually express yourself to a person who you like I've learned it so many times even in a genuinely I've just learned it and I feel like why am I re-learning a dude it's like it's like how is it possible? I'm like that you know some broken AI model who's just you know forgets the context of life over and over it's like it's laughable. I'm even laughing a little bit now. How am I forgetting? The context that I'm in on a daily weekly monthly yearly basis and I look bac I have these reflections. I have these blog posts that I've created where it's like I have these things and that I've made that I just you know to know where I'm at in life and I look back and I'm like bro I did this already. This is d√©j√† vu. I've did this. I've done this. I've cried over a girl who's not texting back, who who I feel like I w not vulnerable enough with or two vulnerable or not I didn't do enough things. I've done this before I've done this tons of tens of times maybe not hundreds, but tens of times and hundreds if you wanna combine all these different situations kind of into one thing I've done this so many times I've done it so so so so so many times and it's like why how am I relearning over and over it's actually insan like can we and I understand by the way I understand like life is about learning life is about progression but I feel like man how have I not progressed dude I was sitting here in 19 thinking the same thoughts about girls at 19 and I solved it. I thought like a 20 x 26 I was sleeping with a lot of women and even I mean, I had a girlfriend when I was 27 I th like I thought I had some of this man you know and I know and I was able to even in my last official corporate job, dude my level of organization and the level that which I was able to ship project projects was insane. I was able to crush new projects over and over and over and here. I am like with these ideas that I'm still talking about after two months or three months of starting it how is it possible that I was able to just crushed through a new project in a fucking week or a couple days and here I am talking about the same bullshit like after three months it's not possible it's insane. How is it? Yeah so let's go through that. I just I want to see the full picture. I need to see the full picture. Bring it home for me like bring it home for me wrap it all up and show me who I am. I need to see it. I need to see it, I need to see it. Honestly, I do wanna double the emotional side a little bit because and then go through practical stuff because it is and I don't know what that means. I don't know what that helps or what it will do, but yeah man it's you hit the nail on the fucking head with all this like it's exact it's exact you got exact thing like it's it's everything it's like yeah who I need to be. It's like well I want to be yeah I wanna be a certain thing in and I and I feel like I can't you know it's with email you you just did it exactly with them. You know it goes across all the things you know with dating I wanna just be a nice boy whatever the fuck that means I just wanna be a nice I just wanna go up to people and say something and be kind of funny and be a nerd and I don't wanna I don't wanna like I don't wanna think of what to do in advance. I don't want to craft the play and I don't want to do any of the stuff and in and the girls don't like me enough. It feels like the girls don't girls don't like me enough for me to just and by the way they have in my life but just now it's just like that yeah they don't like me and they like me by the way girls do like me that's the fucking weird part and all of this things and you understand I'm just gonna I'm probably gonna be repeating myself a little bit but girls do like me you know and I am good at making soft if I'm good at making software I'm good at writing stuff. I'm good at creating things. I know my I know my my clothing is cool people like it. People of know I go to these conferences and people like hundreds of people come up and they want pictures and they want photos and they wanna engage with me and so I know I have external validation of all of the stuff.

I don't know. I stopped because of that that the feel of that you know I feel like we need more of a strategy. I think I need more of a top level strategy all the way down I need to come up with a rollout plan for everything I need better.

You know it's just frustrating so I don't do yeah instead of you know and even with coding with coding like it's it's hard to suck you know coding it's hard to not know you know it's a slow process of learning react or learning you know vite** whatever and you know instead of like taking some time and maybe doing the tutorial once a day or twice a day in addition to all the stuff that I'm doing it's like I'd rather just use a an AI Dev thing you know I'd rather just have one of these LLMs code for me and put push the code instead of like learning some stuff myself like really actually actually learning some of the stuff myself you k you know they'll be some extent of just you know again you know I don't need to know a lot to do this, but like I should be, I want to get to a place where I'm a good developer like I wanna be at. I wanna be able to identify as a developer like why not you know how much effort like if I if I took a react course for like a month, I'd probably know all the stuff and I'd be able to really use these AI tools to their fullest extent and yet I'm just dabbling on the outskirts not willing to learn even one thing and I just it's like why and I'll take some fucking time and you know I can. I have kind of a diagnosed of ADHD, but I don't know if I I think that the problem isn't necessarily the ADHD. I think the problem is whatever you just pointed out. I think the part deacon contribute for sure but it's bigger thing. It's the bigger thing cause I I was able to focus on things before in college man you know I remember when I was a freshman and I was able to study for hours on this shit that I didn't care about you know and I was getting these good grades and I would do the same thing every day and I'll go to the library and you know the lifestyle I live right now it's so similar and yet I don't have the results. I don't have the ou that I could that I should in my opinion half I guess and I'm so afraid yeah I just yeah it's and I was talking to the girl yesterday. You know one of the girls that not this girl that we're talking about with that with this text but the other this, she was circling the circling this she was saying I was afraid of failure and I was like I don't know if I am, but it seems like I might be afraid of failure or afraid of maybe not afraid of failure, but I think that that you have it on the head that fear of like I don't I don't wanna do something shitty I want to put out a good thing. I wanna have a thing where people are like oh shit this is fucking amazing and then like you know and it's hard to like create one like even right now you know I have this some software for the for the for the company that I work for for the business that I that I started it's like we really need like three features like three specific things and when you be able to do them well and it's like three things we don't need a whole platform, but it's like I could create those and I have created those individual elements. Those are already. I have made those things already. You know I've made them and we don't need to make them anymore. It's done and we could put them in the production and get it for me. I wanna make the full application. I wanna make a full app that has everything in it. I wanna make it integrate with Telegram. I wanna make it integrated. I wanna have a Web App side next gues state of the art technology with all the bells and whistles. I want everything even though we only need really need need need to make money to make money and really push. We need two or three things you know it's just so you know it's so I wanna just get like maybe if we can just get some of the emotional I don't know just like really just crack open just really just I wanna see what the full thing I wanna have a full picture of myself right now. I just wanna see myself from the birds iview I wanna see it for I wanna see it. I want to be laid bear raw naked I wanna see everything here. I wanna see it all and then we can do the practical solutions, but I really wanna see everything. I wanna see all the different and I will see how everything connects. How does the dating I wanna see it all cause you hit the nail on the head but I just wanna see it all. I just wanna see it all. I just wanna itch. I wanna scratch the itch. I wanna see it all. It's just it hurts. It fucking hurts and it's makes me feel inferior. Doesn't make me feel good. It makes me feel and I feel like I feel like I should've. I feel like I should've solved this. I feel like I should be done. You know I turned 31 in one month one month from today I'll be 31 and that's so old. no it's not actually old right it's not actually old but it's so old you know and people have kids now people have whole businesses. People are executives peop like people are you know millions and millions of followers and people are all of these things and 10 years younger than me and five years younger than me you know and I'm losing my hair I'm balding I'm balding and I can't. You know some days. It feels like I can't take care of myself. It's you know I had something earlier this month. It's like I lost it like I lost $3000 like and I don't even know where it is. I don't know how I think I just left it on a table and just forgot about it. I don't know if this is and I'm sorry sorry about the non-sex order. It's just like a random thing, but it's like things happen all the time like this you know I can go back and think of these moments where it's like I just you know we have we're on the brink of something crazy and I just like just fuck things up like you I remember you know in 2019 you know I think it's 20 2019 I was a project manager at a decent company and I had a trajectory and yet you know I didn't have enough work and I decided to like not I didn't. I just decided to not learn anything new and just fuck off and you know design clothes at work like why I had I literally just make it like $4000 a month free and clear like doing almost nothing like why would I throw that away? I threw it away. I just threw it away. I just didn't. I just took everything for granted, I threw it and why you know and then you know and then I had some money and then I was making clothes I was drop shipping in the summer and I got some credit cards and I was pushing and I got a loan from Shopify from Shopify and it's like you know I used it but like I didn't fully understand the stuff and I spent all this money and now I've always debt and I can't use credit cards anymore. I destroyed it I destroyed all of my credit and everything and just a year then I went to Russia and I was like OK I'm just gonna move to Russia who cares and even go to Russia dude when I was, I was going to go teach English in Russia and I I like you know literally on the flight like I had a flight. I had that I had everything lined up and I was on the flight and you know I had a layover in Boston and I fucking lost my pass. I put my coat down and I lost my passport like my the one thing I need to just put my coat on the thing and I just forgot it and I just lost it and I couldn't get it back and the police couldn't find it cause there's no cameras in the airport and there's no cameras I guess in the back area of the airport and it's just fine. I don't have a code and I don't have a passport and I had to go back home. I had to ask my friend for money and even after that I have one thing which is I had to save up money. I had to get a new passport three months like a month goes by. I have everything lined up again flight paid for and I and I arrived to the airport late and I miss my international flight. I overslept or I forget the exact thing but I missed it like I miss my international flight. I think I missed it twice and I had to ask one of my friends for help and he helped me and I paid him back but it's like what the fuck and I can't even tell you how many times I've just missed flights. I can't even tell you how many times I miss flights so many times you know and I feel like I just constantly like you know I constantly have these things were just like I don't know like just I don't know. It's like on purpose if it just feels like it's on purpose and it feels like I can't trust myself. It feels like I can't like I feel like I can't trust my brain with basic things and even so even if everything is going well it's like something can just happen. it feels like something can just happen that just you know I was doing well for a while even even without you know OK I'm avoiding all this stuff and I'm you know fear of imperfection but even over the last couple months I was doing OK I was doing fine and then I lost this significant amount of money and now we're like behind on everything you know and it's like for like wow how is it possible? It's like the dumbest thing in the world. I just can't trust my own fucking brain or body with basic things you know it's this and it feels like it's all connected like this like truly internal deep thing inside where it's like if anything starts to go OK then we're just something they're just we're just gonna fucking spike. We're gonna fucking spike the ball in the Enzo and fucking takeoff our clothes and streak around and ruin everything and just and start all over again. you know I don't know what that is. Don't know where it's coming from but that just feels like my life. It feels like every six months every three months we just have a life altering thing just . I just feel like people other people don't have this thing. Why am I do it? Why am I losing this amount of money? Why am I missing these flights? Why am I losing my passports? Why am I like? Why am I having to relearn speaking to women like do you understand the amount of times that I've done this? I feel like I've done even this without AI without AI and without kind of help maybe but it's like I've done this kind of like reset thing like so many times it's not on comment. It's so many times I've learned how to speak to women again and again and again and again I've learned how to work I've learned how to be a basic human being and in a workplace again and again and again and I understand you need to speak to people. I understand you need to hang out with people in the off hours. You need to spend time you need to you need to call them. You need to talk to them even though them even if they don't put in every themselves you have to do that you have to do that to have good relationships in this life and I understand that and I've had to relearn it, redo it again and again I've had to relearn assertiveness. I've had to relearn what it means to be a man what it mea to express yourself to a girl what it means to be genuine and not some Disney genuine, like not some charming like actually express yourself to a person who you like I've learned it so many times even in a genuinely I've just learned it and I feel like why am I re-learning a dude it's like it's like how is it possible? I'm like that you know some broken AI model who's just you know forgets the context of life over and over it's like it's laughable. I'm even laughing a little bit now. How am I forgetting? The context that I'm in on a daily weekly monthly yearly basis and I look bac I have these reflections. I have these blog posts that I've created where it's like I have these things and that I've made that I just you know to know where I'm at in life and I look back and I'm like bro I did this already. This is d√©j√† vu. I've did this. I've done this. I've cried over a girl who's not texting back, who who I feel like I w not vulnerable enough with or two vulnerable or not I didn't do enough things. I've done this before I've done this tons of tens of times maybe not hundreds, but tens of times and hundreds if you wanna combine all these different situations kind of into one thing I've done this so many times I've done it so so so so so many times and it's like why how am I relearning over and over it's actually insan like can we and I understand by the way I understand like life is about learning life is about progression but I feel like man how have I not progressed dude I was sitting here in 19 thinking the same thoughts about girls at 19 and I solved it. I thought like a 20 x 26 I was sleeping with a lot of women and even I mean, I had a girlfriend when I was 27 I th like I thought I had some of this man you know and I know and I was able to even in my last official corporate job, dude my level of organization and the level that which I was able to ship project projects was insane. I was able to crush new projects over and over and over and here. I am like with these ideas that I'm still talking about after two months or three months of starting it how is it possible that I was able to just crushed through a new project in a fucking week or a couple days and here I am talking about the same bullshit like after three months it's not possible it's insane. How is it? Yeah so let's go through that. I just I want to see the full picture. I need to see the full picture. Bring it home for me like bring it home for me wrap it all up and show me who I am. I need to see it. I need to see it, I need to see it."
