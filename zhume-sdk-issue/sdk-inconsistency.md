# [Bug] Inconsistency between TypeScript types and runtime: customVoices vs custom_voices

**Describe the bug**
There's an inconsistency between the SDK's TypeScript types/documentation and its runtime behavior regarding the custom voices API. This inconsistency breaks from the established pattern used by all other endpoints in the SDK.

Note: This appears to be an issue with the Fern-generated code, as all SDK files are auto-generated from Fern API definitions.

**To Reproduce**
1. Install Hume SDK version 0.9.8
2. Try to use the custom voices API following the SDK's documentation:
```typescript
const voice = await client.empathicVoice.customVoices.createCustomVoice({
  name: settings.name,
  base_voice: settings.baseVoice,
  parameter_model: settings.parameterModel,
  parameters: settings.parameters
});
```
3. Get TypeScript error: `Property 'customVoices' does not exist on type 'EmpathicVoice'`

**Expected behavior**
The SDK follows a consistent pattern across all other endpoints:

1. TypeScript Class/Interface Names: Always camelCase
   ```typescript
   // In src/api/resources/empathicVoice/resources/*/client/Client.ts
   export class ChatGroups { ... }
   export class Prompts { ... }
   export class Configs { ... }
   ```

2. SDK Access: Always camelCase
   ```typescript
   client.empathicVoice.chatGroups
   client.empathicVoice.prompts
   client.empathicVoice.configs
   ```

3. API Endpoints: Always snake_case
   ```
   /v0/evi/chat_groups
   /v0/evi/prompts
   /v0/evi/configs
   ```

4. Request Parameters: Always snake_case
   ```typescript
   {
     page_number: 0,
     page_size: 10,
     base_voice: "ITO",
     parameter_model: "20241004-11parameter"
   }
   ```

The `customVoices` endpoint should follow this same pattern, but currently:
- The SDK's example shows `customVoices` (correct, matches pattern)
- But the runtime expects `custom_voices` (incorrect, breaks pattern)
- While still using snake_case for parameters (correct)

**Environment:**
- SDK Version: 0.9.8
- TypeScript Version: Latest
- Node Version: Latest
- Generated by: Fern (as indicated by file headers)

**Additional context**
This inconsistency is particularly evident when comparing files:

1. The SDK's example in `src/api/resources/empathicVoice/resources/customVoices/client/Client.ts` shows the correct pattern:
```typescript
await client.empathicVoice.customVoices.createCustomVoice({
    name: "name",
    baseVoice: Hume.empathicVoice.PostedCustomVoiceBaseVoice.Ito,
    parameterModel: "20241004-11parameter"
})
```

2. The API endpoint in `.mock/definition/empathic-voice/customVoices.yml` correctly uses snake_case:
```yaml
path: /v0/evi/custom_voices/{id}
```

3. But the runtime implementation breaks from the SDK-wide pattern by requiring snake_case for the property access:
```typescript
client.empathicVoice.custom_voices  // breaks pattern
```

**Proposed Solution**
Since the SDK is generated using Fern, the fix likely needs to be made in the Fern API definition rather than directly in the SDK code. The solution would be to:

1. Check the Fern API definition for the custom voices endpoint
2. Ensure it follows the same patterns as other endpoints (chatGroups, prompts, configs)
3. Regenerate the SDK with the corrected definition

This would maintain consistency with other Fern-generated endpoints in the SDK and ensure the changes persist through future SDK generations.
